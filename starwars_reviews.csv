0,tt0076759,Star Wars: Episode IV,10.0,"I couldn't have asked for anything more. Star Wars: A New Hope had it all. If I had to sum it up in one word, superlative would be my answer. I saw the film for the first time three months ago and loved it, and since then I have watched all the Star Wars movies. I was disappointed with the prequels (Attack of the Clones was my least favourite), but this, Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back were perfection.I have to say that the film looks absolutely amazing even after thirty plus years, with highly imaginative sets and dazzling special effects. And the action sequences were superbly choreographed and brisk, the Death Star climax was a knockout. The music by John Williams is absolutely outstanding, by far one of his more exciting and rousing scores. The story is fast-paced, intelligent and has an essence of sophistication, and the screenplay is sharp and decisive.And the performances were flawless. In the prequels I had problems relating to some of the performers, namely Hayden Christensen as Anakin. Here, all the actors played their parts with superlative skill. Alec Guiness, one fine actor and will be sorely missed was a standout, likewise with Peter Cushing and Harrison Ford(hilarious here). Carrie Fisher was a fine Princess Leia, spunky, beautiful and sexy, and Mark Hamill was a completely likable Luke. And the villain Darth Vader, without doubt one of the best and in-depth villains in cinematic history, and James Earl Jones's deep booming voice was perfect for the character.All in all, a definite sci-fi classic, that blew me away. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
1,tt0076759,Star Wars: Episode IV,10.0,"The awesome special effects and the creation of creatures that are part of the vivid imagination of George Lucas are not the reason for the enduring popularity of Star Wars and the franchise it spawned. Rather it is because of the characters Lucas created that will live as long as we have cinema and the means to display it.The spectacle is behind some real, but simple people. No shadings of gray in the first Star Wars we know without any doubt who the heroes and villains are of this piece. On an isolated planet a galaxy wide dictatorship called the Empire and the revolt against come to wear young Luke Skywalker as played by Mark Hamill and his family reside. So does Alec Guinness, a reclusive and mysterious hermit. An escape pod crashes there with two androids, C3PO and R2D2 and in the latter is a message for Guinness who was at one time a Jedi Knight, fiercest of a warrior class, from Carrie Fisher playing Princess Leia. Also in R2D2 are the schematics for the Empire's ultimate weapon the satellite size death star that can deal killing out on a planetary scale. This starts an adventure with young Hamill who teams up with futuristic soldier of fortune Harrison Ford as Han Solo and his simian like sidekick Chewbacca to rescue the Princess and defeat the Death Star.Those are the good guys. The bad guys are the blackest of black villainy. Peter Cushing cold bloodedly commands the Death Star, but the mysterious Darth Vader, clad in black with a helmet completely covering his head, has mysterious powers and even his superiors are wary of him. The voice of James Earl Jones is unforgettable as the black prince of the galaxy.These are characters that bring out the kid in all of us. The ones who claim the most sophistication in their lives will cheer on for Hamill and Ford and will be fascinated by the double dyed villainy of Darth Vader.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Star Wars and I speak now of all the films is the way such non-humans as the robots and Chewbacca the Wookie became characters. C3PO had dialog, but R2D2 had a few clicks and bleeks and all Chewbacca did was grunt, still they became as identifiable as the human characters.Star Wars set the standard for science fiction films to come for the next several generations. It was given six Oscars in a bunch of technical categories and it's got a re-release value that Gone With The Wind used to have.The Force Will Be With Us Always."
2,tt0076759,Star Wars: Episode IV,8.0,"Okay, so as a kid this was one of my favourite films. But as you grow up things change and on second viewing, I found this film to be surprisingly slow in places and actually comes close to outstaying its welcome towards the end. These aren't big flaws, mind you, but ones which niggle at me and make me feel as if I'm betraying a universal dream in some way. The truth is that I far prefer the second and third entries in this series, as they don't have to go through the troubles of introducing all the characters, and instead can simply continue the action at a fast speed.There are many good things about this film to make it worthwhile, though. This is one of those movies with a comic book feel to it which can appeal to adults and children alike. There's a sufficiently 'epic' nature to the film, in that a whole other universe has been created and we are merely viewing a part of what happens in it. There's plenty of action, ranging from the traditional light-saber fights to some exciting space skirmishes. The huge budget allows for many, many different special effects. Some of these look a little ropey today but they're all infinitely superior to the overblown, laughable CGI antics in THE PHANTOM MENACE, where all touch with reality was lost.The characters are likable and clear-cut; you've got heroic heroes and evil villains. Mark Hamill is fine as Luke Skywalker, although it's sad that he never achieved success in any other movies NOT in the STAR WARS series. Harrison Ford provides a clean, charismatic action man in Han Solo. Carrie Fisher is pretty and funny as Princess Leia, and Alec Guinness lends heavyweight support to the whole affair with his Obi-Wan Kenobi. The only downside to the cast are the inclusion of the robots C3P0 and R2-D2 and Chewie, who are, seen today in an adult light, pretty irritating, it has to be said. But for kids, they're funny.The villains always tend to be the best guys in these films and this is no exception. Darth Vader is THE king of cool, and I always wanted to be him when I was younger. It's strange to think how strongman Dave Prowse when from being the monster in Hammer's lame HORROR OF FRANKENSTEIN to becoming one of the biggest screen villains of all time. One also mustn't forget the contribution of Peter Cushing in what was his most popular movie; he lends gravity to the movie and is excellent as the icy commander of the Death Star, mainly through his voice alone.Although this is a long film, the action is split up across a number of different planets in order to make it more interesting. There are laser battles, lots of shooting, brief gore (an arm-lopping), and all manner of weird and wonderful rubbery alien creatures to make it enjoyable. I especially loved the scene in the garbage disposal unit which uses the old ""closing walls"" routine on our heroes to great effect. This is a deservedly famous movie which kick-started a whole new mythos, brought a legion of movie nerd fans together and harked back to the great days of the sci-fi serials of the late '30s and '40s. Not the best of the series, but pretty darned good going."
3,tt0076759,Star Wars: Episode IV,,"Star Wars (1977) **** (out of 4) Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) joins forces with Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) as they plan to go after Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) who is being held hostage by Darth Vadar.Whether people like it or not, STAR WARS is one of those ground-breaking movies that became a massive hit and it eventually took over the world. Watching the film so many years later it really is amazing what George Lucas was able to do with this film and what would follow. I will gladly admit that I'm not a fanboy of this series and in fact this recent viewing was the first time I had seen this since it was released in its Special Edition form. With that said, even though I'm not a ""fanboy"" it's impossible to deny that power that this film contains.Storywise there's really nothing overly ground-breaking here but in my opinion that's what makes the film so darn good. There's no long-winded or drawn-out story to drag things down. The basic premise is rather simple as an up-and-coming fighter gets his opportunity to be great and sets out to do so. I think this simple story makes the characters stand out all the better because it really gives them a chance to shine and come to life. It certainly also helps that Lucas was clearly a fan of those cliffhangers from previous decades because he knows how to build up scenes and milk them for everything they're worth.It's really hard to say anything fresh or new about this film but watching this first one it's easy to see why people like Hamill and Fisher became iconic in these parts. Both are quite good in the film as are Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing, the two veterans of the picture. With that said, I think it goes without saying that it's Harrison Ford who really stands out in the role of Han Solo. His comic timing with Chewbacca has made for some of the most memorable moments of this film and he's simply delightful to watch in the role.Of course, fans will debate the tinkering that Lucas has done with the picture but I think both versions hold up extremely well. I understand the purist who want to view what they originally saw in theaters and I understand those who defend the updating of the effects. Either way, STAR WARS is a rare blockbuster that also manages to be extremely well-made and deserving of its reputation."
4,tt0076759,Star Wars: Episode IV,10.0,"This story happened 'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away'. The galaxy is under the dictatorship of the emperor. Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) is part of the rebellion but is capture by the evil Darth Vader. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) the young hero, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) the brigand, his sidekick Chewbacca, and the wise master Jedi Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) must together rescue the princess and save the galaxy.The characters are icons pulled from classic storytelling like Akira Kurosawa's ""The Hidden Fortress"". George Lucas was able to assemble such iconic characters into a well told story. Rarely is a movie change the nature of movie-making, and even the wider culture. This may be on the list of the most important movie ever. It changed the tone of movies from the gritty morally-confused 70s to the popcorn selling blockbusters that are soon to come."
5,tt0076759,Star Wars: Episode IV,9.0,"I will never forget the hoopla associated with this movie. Having seen articles in Time and Newsweek, my friend and I took off early from work and made our way to the one theater in the Minneapolis Metro area that was showing ""Star Wars"" (boy have times changed!). There were local news stations, reporters, models, everywhere. How we were able to just walk to the window and purchase tickets, I don't know, but we did. I still have my blue button with ""May the Force be With You"" emblazoned on it. I'm told it's pretty valuable. A reporter approached us and asked my friend, ""What do you expect."" He responded in his sort of wise ass way, ""A sprawling intergalactic epic.""That was all very interesting, but when we finally sat down and the movie began, I found it was less than I had hoped for. Part of my problem was that at that time, most of what I read was science fiction. As I watched the events unfold, I realized that this movie wasn't really science fiction--it was a Western. It was the good guy versus the bad guy and an effort to save the old ranch that the bad guys have pillaged. Take out the awesome special effects and the cool aliens and it just wasn't very interesting. I realize that most of the people that have seen this consider it just slightly below the second coming--nearly a religious experience--but it wasn't for me. I saw nothing new or complex about the character or the themes in the movie. As far as speculative science fiction it is barren. Don't get me wrong, I still think that there are amazing things to watch, but I can't get past the fact that the storm troopers can't hit the broad side of a barn with laser weapons but the good guys can pick off about a dozen from behind a post. Where did these guys get their training? How has the Empire survived so long with these incompetents. Having read ""Dune"" years before this film came out, I have to be brutally honest--how George Lucas didn't get sued for stealing from that book, I'll never know. I always wondered if he made a deal with Frank Herbert.The worlds are exotic. The aliens are wonderful (although, I thought the second and third movies were much better), especially that bar scene. But the bottom line is that it's an adventure movie. Maybe someday someone will convince me otherwise (I have had about 50 people try). If I'm going to watch a Western, I prefer the Earps and Doc Holliday."
6,tt0076759,Star Wars: Episode IV,,"first stone for a pop culture monument. not impressive. but nice and useful for its profound innocence. an old fashion Star Wars, full of secrets, naive like its heroes, mixture of Medieval stories and Sci Fi, mirror for teenager 's ambitions, dreams and fantasies, proposing interesting characters and fight scenes who seems be more than fireworks. the fight between Good and Evil. start of a legend. and beautiful slices of humor in different forms. a film who preserves the emotion and fascination of its first public. and, sure, the crazy risks for George Lukas. story of three heroes and exotic in admirable manner, it is always fresh. or, maybe, evergreen. for the small details, for the acting - Han Solo could be different? Luke Skywalker is not the best image of the boy from each from us ? and maybe, as more than piece from large puzzle, a wonderful story about courage. and about Force."
7,tt0076759,Star Wars: Episode IV,6.0,"""Star Wars"" is a 2-hour science fiction movie from almost 30 years ago written and directed by George Lucas. There really needs nothing to be said about how good this is for a 1970s movie, especially in terms of technical aspects. The Academy certainly got it right by giving them all these Oscars for it. However, it lacks in certain other areas unfortunately. First of all, the acting isn't too great. That is not really a problem of the characters though, but rather of the way they were written, which simply offered no room for outstanding performances. And Peter Cushing's character was downright forgettable despite being the main antagonist. Instead people remember Darth Vader obviously. Why? Because this film is all about the way the characters look and not what they do or say. A bit style over substance. Apart from that, I am quite surprised Alec Guinness scored an Academy Award nomination for his turn here.The script is not the greatest achievement in general. It's the usual black-and-white characterization with good vs evil and the characters have no real shades, no facets. This was made up again by the strong work in other departments as it's not too memorable what they say and do, but what they look like, especially the non-human characters who are all somewhat considered legendary today. I am not saying the characters are written badly. Not at all. But it's just other contributions that made them what they are today. Not the script. And while I enjoyed most of the film, I cannot see it as an epic or a cult classic as so many people do to this date. ""Star Wars"" is bound to rise again with the new film coming out soon and featuring the original cast again. It should be interesting what they make out of it. Until then, feel free to watch the old films like this one, but not too many. The very first Star Wars film here is not a great achievement in terms of story, only in terms of all visual and audible aspects."

She assigns the droid to deliver the plans to Obi-Wan Kenobi with a message to give the plans to the rebels. R2-D2 flees to the Planet Tatooine with his fellow C-3PO in a space pod and land on the desert, but they are captured by Jawa traders. They are sold to Owen Lars (Phil Brown) and when his nephew Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is cleaning the droid, he accidentally activates part of the message and he wonders whether it would be addressed to the old Ben Kenobi. On the next morning, Luke discovers that R2-D2 is seeking out Obi-Wan Kenobi and he goes after him with C-3PO. They are attacked by the Tusken Raiders and saved by a drifter, who is Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) that tells part of his past as Jedi to Luke. He also tells that his father was a Jedi Knight and gives a light-saber that belonged to his father to Luke. Obi-Wan invites Luke to travel with him to Alderaan and when he finds that his family was killed by the Imperial soldiers, he decides to join Obi-Wan in his quest. They head to Mos Esley to hire a skilled pilot and they team-up with the smugglers Han-Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). Meanwhile the evil Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) orders to destroy the planet Alderaan to show the power of the Death Star to Leia and the rebels.

What will happen to the group and Princess Leia? Will they succeed in delivering the information to the rebels?""Star Wars"", later retitled ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" is the unforgettable and charming sci-fi adventure that surprised the world in 1977. The strategy of George Lucas that claimed that there was no technology available to the cinema industry in 1977 to produce the three first chapters was part of a marketing strategy that kept alive the interest of fans fro the whole six chapters, In sequence, great part of the mystery would not have raised. All the films are engaging, but none of them can beat this one rated #19 in IMDb. Harrison Ford in the top of his career and the cast show a wonderful chemistry. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Star Wars: Episódio IV – Uma Nova Esperança"" (Blu-Ray) (""Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope"")"
9,tt0076759,Star Wars: Episode IV,,"The Republic has fallen and the Empire rules the galaxy as a dictatorship, seeking to destroy dissenting voices. The Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, is fully on line and capable of destroying whole systems. The Jedi have been destroyed, save a few living in hiding, unable to compete with the force of the Empire. However Princess Leia has the plans showing a weakness within the Death Star. Before she is captured by Darth Vader she gives them to droids C3PO and R2D2 and they escape. When they land on a nearby planet they find Luke Skywalker and set out to find the owner of the droids Obi Wan Kenobi, or Old Ben Kenobi. Obi Wan begins to train Luke in the way of the force as they try to get the information to the Rebellion before the Death Star can be used at full power.It's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking  lets be honest, Lucas isn't the Shakespeare of our generation. However what it is, is a good story of good v's evil, a western of goodies v baddies set in space. The story is simple but contains clear characters. The thing that sets it apart is the fun  the sense of wonder for kids but also the enjoyment it brings to adult. The story is good for a sci-fi with a lot of history and back-story clearly set out up front. The action scenes are mostly great  not dry effects but with a real sense of action and excitement too.This may be the 4th part but it's also our first chapter, it is light and enjoyable but hints that this is only part of an ongoing battle. The way it relates to kids and adults is obvious as it broke records and everyone of a certain age knows about Star Wars! The effects still look good today  in many ways the model work looks better than all digital effects simply because they are `real' and don't just exist within a computer. Sound effects, comedy, music  it's all pitch perfect and sets up the rest of the series really well.Hamil is ok as Skywalker (`Blonde hair, blue eyes'  Chasing Amy!). He is suitable for a kids film and he does well with his role. However like part 1 has Anakin at his least interesting, part 4 has Luke yet to develop into darker areas. Ford is perfect as Han Solo  he adds character and flair to some dry performances. Alec Guinness adds maturity to the whole film and is so good is Obi Wan that even Ewan McGregor just does an impression rather than recreate the role. Darth Vader is just the right side of silly camp villain, Jones' voice is a perfect fit and he has real menace and power. Bits players such as Chewie, C3PO, R2D2 etc all add comedy in spades.Overall this film is even better now that we know how it all fits together in Star Wars `history'. But even without all the hype this is a really fun sci-fi that is enjoyable, simple and really good fun to watch if you're in the mood. Having a deeper perspective on it just makes it all the better."
10,tt0076759,Star Wars: Episode IV,10.0,"I couldn't let the thirtieth anniversary season of ""Star Wars"" slip by without a commemorative viewing today to remind me of the start of this hugely successful franchise. Though it's not one of my own personal Top Ten films of all time, I can understand how so many fans come to see it that way. At the time it was a seminal film that reinvigorated the sci-fi genre; my first viewing when it debuted in theaters garnered more than a single 'Whoa' with each new scene and concept that hadn't been done before. I was particularly intrigued with the names of the characters George Lucas created for his heroes, sounding uniquely original and matching their physical description and characters. Could Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, or Princess Leia have been called anything else? How about Jabba the Hutt; he looks exactly how a Jabba the Hutt would look if there was a Jabba the Hutt. Makes sense, doesn't it? I get a kick out of the nay sayers on this board who have such a fierce guttural reaction to the success of the entire Star Wars franchise, never missing an opportunity to thrash it unmercifully. The best response to that I guess would be that they represent a mere six and a half per cent minority of the IMDb voting history for this film that give it less than a 6.0 rating. It reminds me of that joke about the one in three people who might be crazy, and your two best friends seem alright. Something to think about.Anyway, there's no point in detailing the film since virtually every one on the planet has probably seen it at least once, even my wife. My son, who was born in 1977, has probably seen it thirty times a year every year since he started watching movies, kind of a record in itself I would think, allowing him to quote virtually every line of dialog from the movie. Such is the compelling nature of true Star Wars fans, who while watching, find themselves in a galaxy far, far away."
11,tt0076759,Star Wars: Episode IV,10.0,"Well, everyone knows ""Star Wars"": a long, long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford) battle Darth Vader's evil forces. Obviously, this is probably one of the top five most famous movies of all time, and it has truly withstood the test of time. It doesn't suffice to call ""Star Wars"" a sci-fi, a fantasy, or anything really; it is everything that a movie could be. Looking back on it, we notice that it was actually pretty low tech (which is part of why ""Episode 1"" was so bad).Well anyway, the point is that George Lucas created the ultimate masterpiece here. This movie will live on forever."
12,tt0076759,Star Wars: Episode IV,10.0,"This is where it all started, the original trilogy and saga of science-fiction epic adventures, from Oscar and Golden Globe nominated writer/director/creator George Lucas. ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away"" the universe in ruled in fear by the Empire, and a new threat has been completed, the Death Star battle station. The rebels however have managed to capture the plans for the station, and Senator Princess Leia Organa (introducing Carrie Fisher) places them into the memory of droid R2-D2 (Kenny Baker). R2 with companion droid C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) escape the ship and land the desert world Tatooine, the Princess meanwhile is held captive by the Emperor's trusted servant Darth Vader (acted by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones) and battle station leader Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing). R2 and 3PO meanwhile eventually end up with farm boy Luke Skywalker (introducing Mark Hamill) who lives on the planet with his Aunt and Uncle. While cleaning R2, he comes across the message from the Princess, mentioning Obi-Won Kenobi (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Sir Alec Guinness), an former Jedi Knight who they find in the desert. After his relatives are killed, Luke wants to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi. They contract pilots of the Millennium Falcon, Han Solo (introducing Harrison Ford) and Wookie Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) to take them across the galaxy at light speeds. They travel to what was the Princess's planet, Alderaan, but they are pulled in by tracker beam by what destroyed it, the Death Star. After avoiding the stormtroopers, and rescuing the Princess, they eventually escape after removing the beam, but Obi-Won was killed (and became one with the Force) after being killed by his former pupil, Vader. The concluding scenes are the craft and laser battles with the Rebels and the Empire, Darth Vader escapes (giving way to the sequel), and Luke eventually blows up the Death Star (with a great explosion), and the heroes are rewarded, a happy ending.

13,tt0076759,Star Wars: Episode IV,7.0,"After seeing all six episodes of the Star Wars saga several times apiece, I still think this initial entry is interesting but one of weaker ones in the series. Perhaps that's because by now, the special-effects look primitive but also because it's a little slow in parts, slower than the other five films. Sometimes, though, it's nice to have more lulls as these modern-day action films many times overdo the violence. This one, however, is just a bit too slow overall.The first hour of this film sets up the second hour plus the two sequels that followed in the 1980s, showing how the principal characters were united, who they are fighting against and what mystical powers they have at their disposal. Note: it was even interesting to watch this film decades later after the final installment, episode 3, was viewed. It made this first entry make a little more sense, knowing the complete story (who was related to whom, how some died, etc.). It was also a shock to go back and see the special-effects in here after viewing those final three films issued in recent years.I always got annoyed, to be honest, at two things in this initial Star Wars film I felt were overdone: the ""Rambo"" mentality in which hundreds of shots are fired at the good guys and never hit them and the constant arguing between Carrie Fisher (""Princess Leia"") and Harrison Ford (""Han Solo""). By the third film, thankfully, that bickering stopped and everyone was ""on the same page.""Despite how old this film is, it's a ""must"" for this collection since it sets up so much of what is to follow. It's also kind of fun to look at this again and see how young everyone looks!"
14,tt0076759,Star Wars: Episode IV,9.0,"When I first watched this in the cinema I was ten, it was 1977 and I'd never seen anything like it. It had me gripped from the start when a small spacecraft flew past being fired upon by another much larger one that was so big that it seemed to take ages to pass over the viewer. Unlike the recent prequels scenes such as this weren't cluttered with excessive CGI activity but instead showed what was needed in a way that hadn't been seen before. The special effects used throughout the film were ground-breaking for the time and still look great to this day, there is something more real looking about the models used when compared to today's CGI.The main character are all interesting and likable and the acting was all pretty good both from veteran actors like Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing who brought a suitable gravitas to the film and from younger actors Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher who brought a sense of youthful energy.In the unlikely event that somebody doesn't know what the film is about I'll give a brief synopsis; Set in a distant galaxy the forces of the evil galactic empire are hunting down the rebels who are attempting to restore the old republic. They are about to capture a rebel ship which has the stolen plans to the empires latest weapon, the Death Star, when they are hidden in a small robot (droid) by the name of R2-D2 by Princess Leah, he escapes in one of the ships escape pods along with his companion C3PO. They escape to the desert world of Tatooine where they are swiftly captured by strange creatures called Jawas who sell the pair to a farmer who gets his nephew Luke to clean them. While doing so he stumbles across a holographic message addressed to one Obi-Wan Kenobi. While Luke is off having his dinner R2-D2 escapes seeking Obi Wan.The next day Luke sets off to find him but shortly after doing so he is ambushed by Sand People who start ransacking his vehicle till they are disturbed by a robed figure who turns out to be Obi-Wan. He explains to Luke that he was once a Jedi knight and friend of his late father who had been killed by another Jedi called Darth Vader who had turned to the dark side of the force, they also see the full message that R2 is carrying which requests that Obi-Wan takes R2 to the planet Alderaan to get the plans to the rebels. While this is happening Vader who is on the ship searching for the plans dispatches troops to search for the two missing droids. By the time Luke returns home it is too late, the place is a burn out ruin and his aunt and uncle are dead. He decides that he will join Obi-Wan on his mission to Alderaan.They hire a ship, called the Millennium Falcon, from a smuggler called Han Solo who needs the money to pay off a debt and avoid the various bounty hunter who are after him. When they arrive at Alderaan they find it is no longer there, it has in fact been destroyed by the Death Star in an attempt to get Princess Leah to tell them where the rebels are based. Soon after arriving the Millennium Falcon is captured after it goes to investigate a small moon that turns out to be the Death Star. While Obi-Wan is off trying to disable the tractor beam that captured them Han and Luke discover that Princess Leah is being held in the detention area and set off to rescue her... I won't say any more as I don't want to spoil the ending.I think this is a film every body should see at least once, it might not be perfect but if it wasn't for this recent cinematic history would be quite different; it kick-started a revival in science fiction that lead to things like Battlestar Galactica, the return of Star Trek and Alien and was possibly the first ""block-buster"" film. In many ways it was more than just a film it was an event; everybody at my school was talking about it and little else, till one watched it you were completely out of the loop. The characters and there adventures in this and the other films in the franchise have become part of modern folklore.These comments were made based on the video released in the '80s... so no extra CGI and Greedo didn't even attempt to fire before Han killed him."

16,tt0076759,Star Wars: Episode IV,10.0,"Having grown up with the ""Star Wars"" trilogy, then ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" is a classic in every sense of the word. This is the epic story of good vs. evil and of light vs. dark. But it is also a story of heroism, bravery and adventure. I am an fan-boy, yes, but what is there not to love about ""Star Wars""?George Lucas really managed to piece together a timeless classic that stands its own even today. And even with effects from 1977 it was light years ahead of its time, no pun intended. And the effects stand their ground even by todays standards.There is something uniquely amazing about the atmosphere and feel of the ""Star Wars"" universe. And it doesn't require much to be swept away and carried along to a galaxy far, far away...The cast in ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" did a good and memorable job with their individual roles and characters. And with this movie George Lucas established some characters that instantly became well-known and well-loved.""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" is a movie of high space adventure with vibrant characters, creatures and spaceships. It is an enjoyable movie for the entire family, space nerds or not.If you are not already familiar with the legendary ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" movie, then it is more than due time to get to it."
17,tt0076759,Star Wars: Episode IV,10.0,"There was no way my review of this classic slab of pulp sci-fi was ever going to be anything but glowing; as a nine year old I saw George Lucas' space opera on its original release and instantly became one of a legion of fans who spent the next twenty years worshipping at the altar of the great turkey-necked director (until The Phantom Menace shattered all of my illusions).Thirty years on, and I'm revisiting Star Wars with my two children, hoping that they will fall in love with it as much as I did, way back when all that seemed important was having a bag-full of marbles and a decent sized pile of comics to read.I'm not going to describe the plot (surely you know that!), nor am I going to go into great detail about how Lucas borrowed elements from the movies he loved to bring us his epic about a farm boy who becomes a legendary warrior; all I can say is that the film has lost none of its ability to astound and my kids sat entranced (despite not being able to follow the story without the benefit of some additional info from their sci-fi geek dad). My son (who is only three and a half ) might not understand what a 'rebellion' is, and my daughter (nearly six) may struggle with the concept of 'the force', but both got a kick from witnessing the whole Star Wars universe for the very first time.Chewbacca was an instant hit with my boy, whereas my girl identified with Leia, the gutsy princess. Both of them loved the brilliantly realised landscapes, aliens, robots and spaceships that have wowed film-fans for three decades (and who can blame themthe attention to detail and sheer creativity in design, costume, and make-up is staggering).It has since become evident that old George ain't always the greatest writer or director in the world (the last three Star Wars movies are proof of that); however, when he does get it right, he works miracles (he wrote Raiders of the Lost Ark tooanother solid gold movie).Star Wars is perfect family entertainment that delivers amazing spectacle, unforgettable characters and enough movie magic to last a lifetime. In fact, why not do yourself a favour: get off the internet and go watch it right now (even if you have seen it hundreds of times before)."
18,tt0076759,Star Wars: Episode IV,,"My five children were all under the age of 10 when Star Wars came to the theater. While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, 'Star Wars' filled our imaginations like no other movie before it. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.The Star Wars movies also were responsible for jump-starting the career of Harrison Ford, and today he is probably better known for his next trilogy, as Indiana Jones. The DVDs finally came out last month, and they are near perfect, as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high, and the picture is nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track. My wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi -- compliments of our local public library. It was an appropriate reminder how good these movies are, and still ahead of their time. Nothing else has been made to compare to them."
19,tt0076759,Star Wars: Episode IV,6.0,"From ""Star Wars "" onwards,sci-fi became the most popular genre for a while.It as a return to simplicity,in spite of the huge special effects.Actually,the screenplay could have been written by a ten-year old,and the characters ,stereotyped and Manichean ,will not do any harm,will not raise intellectual dilemma.Princess Leia Organa is totally sexless and seems to come from some forgotten fairy tale.Luke is a pale shadow from a knight of the round tables without a Graal to conquer,and Han Solo is the masculine raider we've already seen in a lot of movies. Humor,like in Fredric's Brown tales?none,unless the two robots count. Mystery ,like in AC Clarke's 2001?none,unless Darth Vader 's hidden identity counts? The last quarter of the movie recalls a giant video game. After ""star wars""(and close encounters of the third kind) ,intellectual sci-fi was over the hill;now two kinds would share the market between them:the harmless sci-fi for toddlers and brats(Star War saga,ET,the black hole)and the horrific ,brainless and witless sci-fi (Alien and sequels)""2001"" became an ET movie and its overwhelming genius did not influence anymore,alas."
20,tt0076759,Star Wars: Episode IV,10.0,"Star Wars is a film that started it all. Not only the beginning of a 6 movie saga, but many other things as well. The film takes many things as influence (Shakespeare's Hamlet, Flash Gordon serials, old voodoo stuff, and Stanley Kubrick's 2001) and it turns it into a terrific movie experience. Some scenes are not all there, but they are made up for the extraordiary space fights and great quotes ""May the Force be With You"". So, all hail to George Lucas for creating a timeless masterpiece such as this and for many other things (by the way though, even though I think this film is well done, Episode 5 is my favorite)."
21,tt0076759,Star Wars: Episode IV,4.0,"'The New Hope' is the one that started them all for Star Wars back in 1977. It is only due to the prequels that we see its real place within the whole saga.It's a decent enough film, ground-breaking at the time.If you're going from prequels to this one you might find the opening 30 mins a little slow, but the pace really builds after the entry of Obi Wan and never really lets up from there.I find Mark Hamill a little too meek and wooden at times but Harrison Ford more than makes up for it, stealing every scene he's in as the brilliant Han Solo. His chemistry with Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia also adds to the fun.Start at Episode 1 and work up to this smart and funny sci fi film."
22,tt0076759,Star Wars: Episode IV,,"I recently revisited this, and remembered first seeing it. It wasn't the first movie to be heavily hyped. But I recall it as the first one to appeal to kids as a big adventure.In a couple ways, what's come since have ruined this. Lucas himself ruined it by deciding to make all those extra ones, making up the story as he went. And of course, every month on average we now have a new special effects movie that matches the star wars franchise in visual ambition. Many of these in fact are fueled by Lucas' several companies.So its impossible to recapture that thrill. At the time, yes we knew he stole from Kurosawa, and leaned heavily on Joseph Campbell's notions of myth. But it all seemed so fresh, and Lucas himself came across as a visionary genius. And we needed that more than we needed entertainment.Remember, the US had just been through its first sleazy republican scandal and the nation as a whole was discouraged. But the world of movies was exploding. Woody Allen gave us ""Annie Hall."" Scorcese became known. And then this. The thing that impressed us at the time was how seriously it took itself, despite how childishly goofy that intergalactic bar was. Also how powerful the sounds and images were.The mythology was so clear. We had it for decades in science fiction and fantasy novels, indeed much better. But this was the first time we had them cinematically, and cinema when it works may be the most powerful of packaged imaginations. Oh how I wish we could see it as we did then.Now we notice, for instance, how ordinary the dogfights are. These used to thrill. We don't have all the mystery that made the thing deep. Now we know who everyone is and what is going on, and it is all so much more ordinary than what we imagined at the time as possibilities.In later years, Lucas would let us down, as a person and in this saga. In fact, I think he ruined some things. But for the year of this event, he was the most celebrated singer in the choir. And by me as well.What do I mean about ruining? Things evolve. When one thing finds a niche and flourishes, it pinches off other things. When ""Birth of a Nation"" became a huge success, it froze movies as filmed plays with a larger stage instead of one of the several other directions it could have taken. Again, there was a period after talkies reinvented the medium where there was a struggle among various different directions. This you can clearly see in the period. In retrospect, it appears as if the world could have only turned out the way it did. But the trends that win aren't the best at all.So ""Star Wars"" opened up a gateway for how effects could transform cinema into something far beyond what we had before. And then it closed that gateway, so that effects now cannot show you something unfamiliar. Instead, it all has to be the familiar taken to some extreme.Yes, it was a goose at the time. But Star Wars killed the greater possibilities of science fiction. In film, at least, and because books are inherently cinematic now, in books too.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
23,tt0076759,Star Wars: Episode IV,10.0,"Princess Leia is captured and held hostage by the Imperial Army as it seeks to rule the Galactic Empire. An old Jedi Knight by the name of Ben ""Obi-Wan"" Kenobi may just be hers, and the rebels only hope. Teaming up with farm boy Luke Skywalker, scoundrel Captain Han Solo, and a couple of quirky droids, Kenobi sets off on a mission that could well shape the destiny of the Galaxy, and all who dwell within it.Back in 1977 I was but a wee 11 year old boy, weened on films from all genres by my movie loving parents, I had no idea that Star Wars was to have the same impact on me as Jaws had two summers previously, where yet again I found myself queueing around the block for two whole hours to see a film in a one screen theatre. My love of cinema firmly cemented, Star Wars was the start of a love affair that lasts to this very day.As the years have rolled by and my love of cinema has taken on more in-depth and serious tones, I have come to realise that Star Wars proves to be a far from flawless picture. Certainly its detractors do point to some frayed acting and call the plot structure a jazzed up good versus evil axis, while the charge of George Lucas referencing many prior pictures most assuredly stands, but really do those things matter? No they do not, because Star Wars opened up a new world of cinema, something of a portal to youngsters such as I, it got people talking and debating about the merits of model work in films (which is of an extraordinary high standard here), it nudged film makers to explore being bigger and bolder in their approach, and crucially, above all else, it got film goers hungry again, a hankering for more please if you may. Now it has to be said that all that followed 20th Century Fox's historic blockbuster didn't run with the baton, in fact most pale into comparison on impact value, but for better or worse (depending on the discerning viewers peccadilloes), Star Wars stands as a bastion of adventure laden entertainment.It is by definition one of the most successful films in history, George Lucas perhaps didn't know it at the time, but in what was to become an almost operatic anthology, he didn't just make a movie, he created a whole new world seeping with style and rich texture. Almost as amazing as the success of the series, is how it has become part of modern day pop culture, anything from religion to everyday speak has at some time or another referenced Lucas' baby. Ultimately, though, it's one single thing that made (and still does make) Star Wars so great, it's that it has the ability to lift the audience into a rousing united feel good cheer; and that is something that few films can ever lay claim too. In 1977 it was an awe inspiring event to watch in the theatre, now here in my middle age it's an event that is like hugging a dear old friend, a friend that I know will never ever let me down no matter how many times I turn to it. 10/10"
24,tt0076759,Star Wars: Episode IV,7.0,"I`ve never really thought much of STAR WARS . I remember when it was released in 1977 everyone was going bannanas as to how good it was . I finally managed to see it when it was broadcast on television in 1982 and was very disappointed with what I saw , okay it was entertaining to a certain degree but I didn`t believe for one moment it deserved the hype or massive audience figures . One other thing that sprung to my mind many years later is that it`s unoriginal!!!! SPOILERS TO THIS AND LOTR !!!!I can`t help thinking that Obi Wan Kenobi has been based on Gandalf from LORD OF THE RINGS . They`re both wise old men , they both "" die "" a heroic death and both come come back as etheral beings in the trilogy and both are played in the films by Knights of the stage. However whereas Ian Mckellan gives an outstanding performance as Gandalf Alec Guinness has little impact as Obi Wan . I do not say this lightly as I rate Guinness as the greatest actor of the 20th century . In fact as one reviewer has already pointed out none of the actors give much of a performance except Harrison Ford who is the only member of the cast who went onto become a household name . Compare the performances of the cast of the LOTR trilogy who could all easily pass as Knights of the stageI`m not saying this is a bad movie - it`s not . It is entertaining and does have a sense of humour and the costume design is excellent especially the stormtrooper uniforms but what I`m saying is it`s not a great one either and certainly doesn`t deserve to be in the IMDB top ten movies . And as a footnote is it just coincidence that Christopher Lee was cast in ATTACK OF THE CLONES after appearing in LORD OF THE RINGS ?"

27,tt2527338,Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker,6.0,"The Empire is in chaos. There is a pretender on the throne. A new rebellion is banished to the Outer Rim. The Empire is re-establishing control with yet another Order. At least, it's not another Death Star. It's Disney Plus spaceships with guns. The Mouse Empire muddles on. The new trilogy is simply not planned out. That is its major flaw above all else. This final chapter tries to take back a few story elements and wrap up the story with a bow. It is not to be dissected for plot holes or logic flaws. It rushes to push the franchise across the finish line. It works to some extend and it doesn't cause any more major troubles. Most fans would probably be satisfied with reaching the finish line and not having any more movies for awhile.Nobody is a somebody. A shocking reveal happens and it barely clears the bar. There are plenty of problems and an Orphan Black situation. Like many elements in this movie, one should not think too hard about it. Remember Tom Cruise's War of the Worlds. This one does something even crazier with its spaceships. This is the stupidest part of the plot but let's roll our eyes and move on. The plot is basically getting the MacGuffin to get another MacGuffin. The film is running on double time and the speed seems to be used to hide from story questions. Everybody is rushing. History is being revised. No one is throwing away a light saber in this one. Finn never actually say the thing to Rey. It is emotionally safe. I thought they would keep Carrie Fisher in the first act but they dragged her out there for too long. I won't say that it's disrespectful but it is a little awkward. Overall, this one tries to quickly wrap up the story in a fan friendly way and the last person turns out the lights."
28,tt2527338,Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker,7.0,"I thought the The Rise of Skywalker made a fitting end of Disney's Star Wars trilogy. It marks the end of the original characters, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo.It also deals with Rey's story and that of Kylo Ren. Destiny and redemption.The evil empire is not quite finished nor are the Sith. Kylo Ren aims to mimic his grandfather and discovers that Palpatine was always in control.Rey and the rebels search for the planet where Palpatine is hiding. It will bring Rey into conflict with Kylo Ren and she will find her true heritage.Although 20 minutes too long, this one is aimed at fans. Well fans who do not use terms like 'Mary Sue' or 'Woke.' Just imagine if there were internet forums back in 1980 when The Empire Strikes Back was released. Hold on what's a black man doing there?There are nods to the past, Lando Calrissian returns, Wedge Antilles flies by. You can even spot Ewoks.There were also poignant moments, Chewbacca's reaction to the death of Leia was rather emotional. Knowing this is likely to be the last time we shall see Hamill and Ford in a Star Wars movie. I am sure there would be more Star Wars movies in the future but this is an end of an era."

30,tt2527338,Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker,8.0,"The battle continues. We discover Rey's heritage and I admit I was wrong about Obi-Wan. We quickly find out the Emperor and Ian McDiarmid are still alive and control little Darth as they go on planet destruction. Past characters are brought into the feature, both living and dead. Thank you for not reviving Jar Jar Binks. There is plenty of action and Rey is seemingly placed in a no-win situation. Billy Dee Williams makes a surprise return, as does Mr. Ford.There were unexpected things, but when they did happen it felt cliche and expected. I liked the campfire ending in episode 6 better than this one. Disney leaves open a possible sequel 20 years from now when Rey has twins, one good and one evil. Yes, worth watching on the large screen, but what Star Wars wasn't? Okay, there were a few."
31,tt2527338,Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker,6.0,"I know that many have waited for this. And I can tell you they were way more excited than I was. I have watched the Star Wars movies and I am not as big a fan as many of them are. I don't dislike the movies or the franchise. I just never was as big a fan as many were. One of the reasons is, I never had the experience as a kid. So while I totally get what some feel about them, and I respect that, I hope the same is attributed to me and my views.Having said all that, the movie is what one should and could expect. With some twists that may not make much sense, but get the thing to the intended ending everyone was ... well at list wishing for. Not exactly as it happens here of course, but still. You can't make everyone happy, that is just not possible. So this is either religion for you or just plain fun for a couple of hours. The director tried his best to please as many people as possible, which might not be necessarily a good thing ... but there you go"
32,tt2527338,Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker,7.0,"Much like the episodes 'The Force Awakens' and 'The Last Jedi', I'm left with sort of a ho-hum feeling about this last picture in the Star Wars franchise. It's certainly got it's share of now familiar characters and monumental action scenes, but somehow it didn't seem enough. It felt like the film makers tried to cram in as much story as possible into the picture, but in so doing gave us some confusing scenarios that don't gel very well with the past. The return of Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) is one example, and that was a pretty major one. Internal consistency is also a problem, when someone like Rey (Daisy Ridley) can maintain an epic power struggle with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) over the escaping air ship, but then has to exert herself climbing a rock face later in the picture. Why rely on human strength when you have all this mystical ability at your command? I did like the nods to the original players in the Star Wars saga, as the writers found a way to bring back Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa and Lando Calrissian. That was essentially a given knowing that the nine part series had now reached it's finale, and that sort of tribute was well deserved. As one who's been around as long as the franchise, I'm pretty much happy and satisfied that the story has run it's course fulfilling George Lucas's original mission. But if you want the real magic you have to go back to 'A New Hope' and relive how it all began."

I don't see how they would expand the franchise beyond here, and I hope that they don't. Carrie Fisher deserves to rest in peace.Although I gotta admit that it was interesting looking at the cast and noticing that it includes Lin-Manuel Miranda as well as George Harrison's son Dhani."
34,tt2527338,Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker,8.0,"Disney acquiring Lucasfilm was a great decision, the first of the new space saga sequel movies The Force Awakens was brilliant, and the second film The Last Jedi was also fantastic, and after 42 years since the release of the original Star Wars, this was the final film of the franchise, directed by J. J. Abrams (Lost, Mission: Impossible III, Star Trek, Super 8). Basically, a threat of revenge has been received from Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), assumed to be dead years ago. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), having obtained a Sith wayfinder device on the planet Mustafar, finds the Emperor on the uncharted planet Exegol. The Emperor reveals that he created Snoke as a puppet to control the First Order and lure Kylo to the Dark Side. Palpatine then releases a secret fleet of Star Destroyers and tells Kylo to find and kill Rey (Daisy Ridley), who is continuing her Jedi training, with the help of Resistance leader General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher). A spy within the First Order has delivered information, which Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) say reveals Palpatine's location on Exegol. Rey meanwhile learns from notes left by Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) about a Sith wayfinder can lead them there. Rey, Finn, Poe, Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), BB-8, and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) depart in the Millennium Falcon for the planet Pasana to find an ally as recommended by Leia. There, they find Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), who points them in the direction of the wayfinder's last suspected location. Kylo learns where Rey is through their Force bond and travels there with his warrior subordinates, the Knights of Ren. Rey and the others discover the remains of the assassin Ochi of Bestoon (Liam Cook), his ship and droid, and a dagger inscribed with Sith text, which C-3PO's programming forbids him from translating. The First Order captures the Falcon, Chewbacca, and the dagger. Rey tries to save Chewbacca, but accidentally destroys a First Order transport with Force lightning. The group escape in Ochi's ship, assuming that Chewbacca is dead. Poe suggests traveling to Kijimi to have the Sith text extracted from C-3PO's memory. C-3Po's memory is wiped in the process, but coordinates reveal that a wayfinder is on Kef Bir. Rey senses that Chewbacca is alive, and the group mounts a rescue mission. While Kylo searches for Rey, the group infiltrates his Star Destroyer with the help of Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell), an old acquaintance of Poe's. Rey recovers the dagger and has visions of her mother (Jodie Comer) and father (Billy Howle) being killed with it. Kylo informs her that she is Palpatine's granddaughter; he reveals that Ochi was ordered by the Sith lord to recover Rey as a child, but she was hidden by her parents for her protection on Jakku. General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) saves Poe, Finn, and Chewbacca from execution, revealing himself to be the spy. He lets them escape on the Falcon but is executed by General Pryde (Richard E. Grant) for treason. The group arrives on Kef Bir. Resistance sympathiser Jannah (Naomi Ackie) leads them to the remains of the second Death Star, where the wayfinder is located. Finn is surprised to find out that, like himself, Jannah is also a former stormtrooper, and was one of many deserters. Kylo tracks them down, destroys Rey's wayfinder and asks her to join him to go against Palpatine. Leia is dying, before passing away she calls to Kylo through the Force, distracting him as he duels with Rey, who impales him. Sensing Leia's death, Rey heals Kylo using the Force and takes his ship. She returns to Ahch-To, where the Force spirit of Luke encourages Rey to face Palpatine and gives her Leia's lightsaber. Rey uses the wayfinder in Kylo's ship to make her way to Exegol. After healing, Kylo talks to the spirit of his father, Han Solo (Harrison Ford), after which he throws away his lightsaber and reclaims his identity as Ben Solo. The Resistance then see the planet Kijimi obliterated by a Star Destroyer equipped with a super laser. At the Resistance base, R2-D2 (Hassan Taj and Lee Towersey) restores C-3PO's memory upon the group's return. The Resistance follows Rey's coordinates to Exegol, where she confronts Palpatine. The Emperor wants her to kill him, being his relative he wants to transfer his spirit into her body. Lando brings reinforcements from across the galaxy to join the battle against Palapatine's army, the Last Order. Ben overpowers the Knights of Ren and joins Rey. Palpatine drains the pair's power to rejuvenate himself. He attacks the Resistance fleet with Force lightning and incapacitates Ben. Rey is weakened, she hears the voices of past Jedi, who lend her their strength. Ben revives Rey by transferring his life force into her; they kiss and Ben dies, becoming one with the Force, along with the body of his mother Leia. The remainder of Palpatine's armada are successful destroyed by the Resistance. As the Resistance celebrates, Rey visits the abandoned home of Luke Skywalker on Tatooine. She buries the Skywalker lightsabers, having built her own. A passerby asks her name; she replies, ""Rey Skywalker"". Also starring Kelly Marie Tran as Rose Tico, composer John Williams as Oma Tres and Mary Poppins Returns' Lin-Manuel Miranda as a Soldier, with the voices of James Earl Jones as Darth Vader, Andy Serkis as Snoke, Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker, Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu, Ewan McGregor as the younger Obi Wan Kenobi, Sir Alec Guinness as the older Obi Wan Kenobi, Frank Oz as Yoda, Freddie Prinze Jr. As Kannan Jarus and Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn. The appearances of Hamill, Ford and Fisher (through unused footage from The Force Awakens) are good, Boyega and Isaac are great as the heroes, and McDiarmid returning as the sinister Emperor is welcome, but I agree with critics that this film pretty much belongs to Ridley and Driver, delivering the key moments that will bring the show to a close. I will be honest and say that this finale to the saga is almost the same quality as Return of the Jedi, very enjoyable, but just that tiny something missing, perhaps it is lacking a little emotionally. However, you cannot ignore the spectacular battle sequences, the brilliant special effects and the well-paced action, all together it is a terrific worthwhile science-fiction fantasy action adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Original Score for John Williams, Best Visual Effects, and Best Sound Editing, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Original Music, Best Sound, and Best Special Visual Effects. Star Wars was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!"

37,tt2527338,Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker,5.0,"After the debacle that was The Last Jedi, I (and many other lifelong Star Wars fans) had hoped that lessons would have been learned at the House of Mouse, and that the final film in Lucas's proposed nine-movie saga would end the franchise on a high. Sadly, this is not the case.J.J. Abrams, who also directed the fair-to-middling Episode VI: The Force Awakens, gives us another visually impressive movie full of breathtaking worlds and amazing creatures, but his film suffers from a mediocre plot full of elements that make very little sense and which will annoy the hell out of Star Wars purists.The basic storyline sees Rey (Daisy Ridley) and her rebel pals trying to find where the evil First Order are gathering their forces, so they can launch a final assault and end the tyranny of Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) once and for all. Along the way, Chewie (now played by Joonas Suotamo) is taken hostage, C3-PO (Anthony Daniels) gets his memory wiped, and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) realises that, hey, perhaps being bad isn't for him after all.The whole thing rushes clumsily from one scenario to another with little care for logic, the makers clearly hoping that the dazzling on-screen spectacle will distract the viewer from the fact that nothing here is all that original, and that the narrative is choppy and often confusing, with many contrived moments that are there purely to further the plot, or to retroactively explain away mistakes in the previous movies.My biggest gripe is the scene in which Rey crosses a stormy sea (very impressive digital effects) to the wreckage of the death star. That's right... either the same death star that was blown into a gazillion atoms by Luke Skwalker in A New Hope (or perhaps the second one in ROTJ, also obliterated). Somehow, this massive chunk of debris crashed onto a planet and just happens to hold the artefact required to guide the rebels to the enemy. Talk about convenient. The most pointless scene is an Androcles-inspired encounter with a subterranean serpent. And the most blatant act of back-pedalling comes in a short scene that shows Leia training as a Jedi, so as to excuse her sudden 'space flying' ability in The Last Jedi.Of the bits that actually work, a chase scene involving our heroes on speeders and stormtroopers on caterpillar-tread bikes is exhilarating, a Pasaana festival (celebrated every 42 years! Geddit?) features some wonderful dancing Cthulu-like aliens, there's a cute Anzellan droidsmith called Babu Frik who guarantees a few giggles, Richard E. Grant makes for a nice new villain, and the physical psychic connection between Ren and Rey adds a new twist to the power of the force.Unfortunately, as someone who has been there from the start (I was 9 when Star Wars came out in '77), I cannot help but find Episode IX a disappointment. It's not quite as bad as The Last Jedi or Attack of the Clones (both 3/10 from me), but it's not the rousing finale that we have all been waiting for. Average just isn't good enough."

39,tt2527338,Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker,4.0,"Three movies in to the final part of what is being called the Skywalker Saga and I have to confess: worse than not knowing anything about these new characters -- Poe Dameron, Finn and Rey -- I honestly don't care about them. They're ciphers that we only know the barest of things about. Why does Finn have such an affinity for his friends? Why should we care a lick about Poe when he's proven to be too headstrong and willing to leave people behind, yet has nothing redeeming to make up for it? And Rey has every single skill of the Jedi near-instantly, almost a way too perfect character to be true.Don't tell me I have to read the other books or watch the shows or do my research. Don't tell me that the old films in the Star Wars saga didn't come out as often or perhaps we cared too much about them. I sat -- well, slept, I'll be perfectly honest -- through this too loud and too much installment and I have to tell you my most honest review: Yeah, alright.I don't go to blockbusters to walk away saying, ""Yeah, alright.""SPOILER WARNINGObviously, everything after this will contain massive spoilers. You have been warned.The first critical error the film makes is by telling us that a secret message has caused a stir in the galaxy: the Emperor is alive. You know, instead of a scroll, perhaps this event -- probably the most important thing that's happened in all three of these post Return of the Jedi films, could have been shown to us so we could grasp just how mindblowing it is. Nope. It's in words on the screen. The dead speak! This is lazy filmmaking.Kylo Ren (Adam Driver, who isn't howling in a bar or eating ass in this one) obtains a Sith Wayfinder device and travels to the planet Exegol, where the Emperor is recharging. It turns out that everything evil in the past few films has come from Palpatine, including Snoke who is just a clone. Snoke is the most infuriating character in these films, another character who really has no motivation and no reason to exist other than being yet another Star Wars villain set up to be an undefeatable villain only to, you know, by cut in half. See: Darth Maul, General Grievous, Count Dooku.So the Emperor does what has never been done before. He just plain conjures up a million or so Star Destroyers on a planet that has constant darkness and lightning. He tells Kylo to find Rey, who is studying to be a Jedi with General Leia Organa Solo (Carrie Fisher), who is more Force-sensitive than a Jedi, you know, until this movie, which has a CGI cut scene that looks like, well, a video game cut scene that shows her training with Luke and realizing that she's going to die and not complete her journey but someone else will. Because man, Star Wars is kind of like Catholicism for people who'd rather have Carlos Casteneda instead of John the Baptist.There's also a spy in the First Order, a subplot that changes nothing in the film other than to remind you that General Hux and Ben Solo probably had a tempestuous affair at one point and there's a thin line between love and hate.Rey, Poe, Finn, Chewbacca, BB-8 and C-3PO head out for Passanna to meet Lando Calrissian while R2-D2 stays with Leia in a military base. Soon, Kylo Ben Solo and the Knights of Ren show up just as Rey discovers a Sith dagger than C-3PO's programming forbids him to read. Why? Is it because he was built by Anakin Skywalker? Nah -- it's just another dangling ""We're going to kill off another beloved character"" tease and even when they wipe out the golden droid's memory, it comes back so quickly and easily, you wonder why they even teased this moment of sadness.I also have no idea why the Knights of Ren are important other than they will make cool looking toys and fat dudes will dress like them and bump into me at conventions.Speaking of teasing the death of a major character -- Rey uses Force Lightning to accidentally kill Chewbacca, who died way back in the book Vector Prime before the books were no longer part of the real Universe. But yeah, Chewbacca survives anyway. Seriously, they should have called this movie Star Wars: Let's with Chewbacca. The dude gets tortured, stripped, Rey uses his gun, one of his best friends dies and oh yeah, he had to be in this movie.Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell, who did Alias with J.J. Abrams) is in this too. She's a masked smuggler who had something of a relationship at one point with Poe but they never kissed, which is pretty much par for Star Wars romance. She is not Zam Wesell, so don't get that confused. Honestly, her scene about wanting to leave behind the planet Kijimi is about as emotionally resonant as this movie gets.Turns out that Chewbacca is still alive, so there's a failed rescue mission on a Star Destroyer that leads to a nice scene where Rey and Kylo have a lightsaber battle between their two worlds. That's when we learn that Rey is Palpatine's granddaughter, who tried to King Herrod her as a child, as he feared her power.So hey, why don't we go back to Endor. Do we have to? Yes, we do. That's where we meet a whole bunch of other Stormtroopers who got tired of missing every shot and took off their suits and became dudes who ride yaks. Their leader, Jannah, is not Enfys Nest from Solo: A Star Wars Story, despite similar animal mounts and markings. She and Finn quickly become friends but there's not even a hint of romance.Also: remember when Rose Tico was such a big deal in the last movie? Yeah, neither do the filmmakers.There's a cool scene where the second Death Star is in the giant black waves of Endor and Kylo and Rey have another lightsaber battle. Remember when lightsaber battles were rad and you couldn't wait for them, way back before Yoda zipped all around doing backflips and suddenly, you wondered how and why lightsabers could be boring? Yeah.Man, anyways, Leia dies reaching out through the Force to her son, who gets impaled by Rey but then healed by her before she runs to the Emperor's world to kill the old man, because you know, that's what he wants. He came back from the dead so the child he sent away because he feared she would kill him can kill him. Motivations are super important in Star Wars.Nearly everyone who Hasbro will sell to idiots like me dies. Star Wars has a fetish for hands getting chopped off, British accents, wipe transitions and killing off fat spaceship pilots.Luckily, Rey and Kylo fight back, but then we learn another motivation for the Emperor: he wanted to leech their youth and become strong again. So, if Rey had just killed him, did this second plan even matter? Well, he's every Sith and Rey ends up being every Jedi and they battle and she ends up killing him. However, because she turns his Force lightning against him, she isn't killing him like he wanted and this killing is OK because Star Wars.We end up back on Tatooine where Rey goes to hide the last two lightsabers and claim the name of Skywalker. Then we see Leia looking like the Virgin Mary and Luke looking like some dude who'd go to a comic convention to meet Mark Hamill as ghosts.Question: Remember when it was a big deal that Qui-Gon Jinn didn't turn into a Force spirit and disappear and we were gonna get answers on that one? Yeah. Well, both Leia -- not a Jedi -- and Kylo Ben Solo disappear when they die. Of course, he kisses Rey first. And his dad shows up and calls back the ""I know"" line because this movie is fan service from frame one, bringing back holo chess when it's not sledgehammering plot points and deus ex machina into your feeble brainstem.This movie is a lot like sugary cereal. Sugary cereal is real good, except for how you feel sick after eating multiple bowls.Also: I kind of hate that new green robot D-O who literally talks like a Donald Trump tweet, saying ""Sad!"" when a scene is upsetting. We get it. We know it's sad. You don't have to tell us.The movie also feels like one that should pause and flash: CHECK THIS OUT! Like the tie-fighter parked next to an x-wing. We get it. We get the symbolism. Or when Wedge Antilles shows up, that kind of stuff is only for dudes like me that knew the names and call signs of every pilot. And yes, Wedge is Red Two. I was also a virgin until well into my twenties, thank you very much.So what did I like about the movie? I dug those yak creatures that they rode on the deck of the Star Destroyers and yes, I know they're called orbaks but I'm going to keep on calling them yaks. And I adored Lando basically picking up Jannah and saying, ""Let's find out where you're from."" You know he's making her crosseyed in the back of the Millennium Falcon right now while Nien Nunb wonders why there's a sock on the door. I also liked the little dude named Babu Frik who wiped out C-3PO's mind. And I kinda dug the kintsugi look of Kylo Ren's new mask.Yeah, it was also nice that we saw the first same sex kiss in Star Wars between Commander D'acy and an unnamed character that will surely get a name and a Hasbro San Diego Comic-Con two-pack release that will sell for many times the original price on eBay.Look -- I'm not going to tell you what to like and be a gatekeeper. Love what you love, enjoy what you enjoy and spend your money where you want. That said, I spent a good chunk of my life loving Star Wars and know more about Dengar than many of the extended family members. I know -- and care -- next to nothing about anything in this film. There are people who are going to go see it a few hundred times and get the sugar rush that this film is and love it because it's Star Wars. Again, being a fan of the saga is a lot like being Catholic -- you know the motions, you go through them but after a while, you question why you just don't feel the same after Mass."
40,tt2527338,Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker,7.0,"After 'The last Jedi' divided fans (understatement?) it was up to JJ Abrams to return to guide not only this modern trilogy but also the 'Skywalker Saga' (Eps 1-9) to their conclusion.With so much to do it was a huge task he faced, but on the whole he does a decent job, picking and choosing bits from the 'Last Jedi' to take forward, while also paying a lot of lip service to fans whilst bringing down the curtain.Old favourites have their moments, there's twists and turns galore (some work, some don't) but on the whole this is a decent finale."
41,tt2527338,Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker,,"Reflective EngagementI normally write about folding; the most obvious is when a film contains a film or play, but there are a bewildering number of types. The most interesting of these to me is when the film 'folds' the watcher in, in some way. The least interesting is when a film overtly quotes another. Tarantino, does this in a way that I think distracts from his other strengths.But what happens when you have a series that is older than most people on the planet, and has a world in some way adopted by nearly everyone that folds simple myths into itself?Some of the novel folding Abrams used is required because the original three were never about a world but a story. That world was borrowed from westerns, minimally to support the story, and adapted also minimally to allow the tech. When you don't have a full world to work with, you can't expand the story into it. This world is sparse; if evil exists, it can only exist in and be opposed in one form. So, Abrams has to expand back into the story rather than into the world. He does it partly by direct quoting, adopting the key themes: parents, magical force as military force, and conflict as spatial engagement.I particularly like how he places some action in the ruins of previous movies. In episode 7, we had the star destroyer. Here we've upped the ante with the ruined death star in ultra-dynamic water.But I am going to suggest here that some of what we are seeing in the reflected story qualifies as folding. That's because the original story was a simple instance of what Lucas probably still believes is a universal myth. Enough time (36 years!) has transpired from the original trilogy and enough exposure through aggressive marketing that the original trilogy's instance has itself become the myth on which we now impress our story.Three examples: The other two films advance the story through task episodes, after which there is an escape-chase. In this third case, the film is essentially a collection of chase sequences during which the story is advanced. Because the backbone is a chase, and we have a mature editing grammar for chase episodes, the maturity of pacing is extraordinary. Blockbuster films have advanced this art and Abrams simply uses the best. There's even a situation of our heroes in corridors being hunted by stormtroopers that is filmed as a mini-chase. So, from my perspective, they've folded the confrontations into punctuations between motions.The second example: after all this time, we have competing on-screen narrators. Palpatine has been manipulating things all along and has magical insight into what our characters are doing. This is folding of the viewer into a character, but of an unimaginative kind. In a more noir-quoting film, we'd have periods where we are reminded that our on-screen drama is only because the hapless heroes are being manipulated for our entertainment. Mapping this viewer's narrative control to a villain is common.But we have something far more inventive and for this viewer, thrilling. Our two main characters can actually see each other, across galactic dimension and occupy a shared interspace. The conflict can be conveyed through this narrative space that we share with the two, especially in an extraordinary fight scene where each is projected into the other's space. But it is more than that. The entire new story that is imposed on the old, is about who sees into whom: Palpatine, Leia, Kylo, Rey, Luke, Han, and the mobs on each side have some vision and agency. Each is able to take action through this narrative space. Leia for instance significantly changes things by insight and narrative governance at a distance. Or is that Luke or Han or even Vader working through her?The third example... The original trilogy is a simple quest in the context of pure good and evil. In the first two in this trilogy, the quest is continued, with little change but a different character. In this final instalment, this is no longer the fabric, but the background for a Shakespeare-worthy love story folded into it. This is grownup stuff, and we can see the fan kids and those who want to be objecting. The Disney folks have made a bold choice I think, differentiating from their Marvel property and investing for the long run. Give me a quest for complex urges any day. That's a story fabric I can build my life around. Polar battles between good and evil don't help me and have made my world worse."

43,tt2527338,Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker,8.0,
44,tt2527338,Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker,5.0,"I was going to see this movie. In spite of my severe disappointment with episode VIII I was going to see episode IX. I have 40 years invested in this franchise so I had to finish.This episode boiled down to everybody chasing Rey. Fin was chasing her, Poe was chasing her, Kylo Ren was chasing her, and Palpatine was chasing her. Either someone wanted to help Rey as she wandered away lone wolfing it or someone wanted to convert Rey to the Dark Side--in any case Rey was always being chased.I understand Kylo and Palpatine chasing Rey because as powerful as she was she would've been a powerful asset. As for her friends... I don't understand. She was clearly stronger and more powerful than they or anything they had ever encountered--what did they really expect to do to ""help"" her?We found that Rey was the most powerful being to ever grace the Star Wars franchise. Master Yoda hadn't reached the power level of Rey and he lived 800 years!! Which is weird because she was exhibiting amazing power though she wasn't yet a Jedi. Which makes me realize I have no idea what a Jedi is. I thought once she knew how to use the force she was a Jedi, but apparently she was not.Jedi or not she was displaying some next level skills in a movie that was far from next level. The Rise of Skywalker was Return of the Jedi 2.0. Don't think so? Let's check the boxes: Emperor Palpatine, a secret planet destroying fleet, a Jedi fighting the urge to succumb to the Dark Side, and an unlikely assist to help defeat Emperor Palpatine. This was nothing more than a soulless rendition of Return of the Jedi.I hoped that J.J. Abrams could get us from underneath the rubble Rian Johsnon left us buried in. Maybe it was too herculian of a task to right the wrongs committed in episode VIII or maybe J.J. Abrams was locked into following in Johnson's footsteps. The Rise of Skywalker was nothing more than a retread of past themes blindly hoping to stumble upon success. The script and the performances seemed hollow and devoid of any life. Truly, the success of this movie resided in the name.The Star Wars brand Disney paid so handsomely for has proven to be a cash cow for the company. Regardless of whatever writer and director and their tinkering and experimentation they leave some core remnants intact and bring in the dough. Even if their tinkering mars Star Wars they will never destroy it. Star Wars has no shortage of fans such as myself that will pay to see a film titled ""Star Wars,"" but thank God this series is over."

After all, I thought, Jerry ""Stumble-foot"" Ford reincarnated as ""Jar-Jar BINKS""?! ""Come on, get real"" an inner voice objected. However, as several new books out in the past two months document, STAR WARS IX: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER continues this saga's uncanny knack of dove-tailing closely with Real Life, from 1900s SITH ringleaders Noxious Nixon and Ford to more recent criminals, including The Gypper, The Weasel and The Orange Buffoon (obviously a dead ringer for Emperor PALPATINE). Just as Real Life unmasked the fact that Jar-Jar was a SITH mole, The Art of STAR WARS discloses that our POTUS #45 is a satanic SITH (aka, Red Commie Russian Kremlin KGB) asset, planted inside America's once-hallowed Oval Office to dance around like a marionette on strings--a pawn with no volition of its own, compelled to surrender wars, treasonously give up military secrets, betray and back-stab loyal allies, torment Ukraine and degrade the USA into a hellacious lawless knock-off of Mother Russia.

I honestly still don't know who some of these characters are or care. Finn and Poe haven't exactly made an impression, Rey's barely holding it together by a thread. Adam Driver again and as always, awful. Palpatine takes out Kylo Ren because he gets up, but just allows Rey to recover leading to his end. Don't like that kind of stupid silliness."

J.J. Abrams couldn't come up with anything as good as George Lucas's original story and characters, so he just borrows and mixes enough to try to fool us into thinking we're getting sequels rather than reboots, but he fails. Rian Johnson tried to take the story in some new and potentially interesting directions (though ""The Last Jedi"" had plenty of flaws in its own right), but all of them are thrown out the window in ""Rise of Skywalker."" It's like the second installment never even happened. The only moments that roused me from my theater seat were those that referenced the original trilogy.Worst of all, ""The Rise of Skywalker"" undermines even the modest joys to be had from ""The Force Awakens"" and ""The Last Jedi,"" because now we see the story in its entirety and are aware of how flimsy it all is. It's painfully obvious that this trilogy's story was made up as it went along and not conceived as a cohesive whole. That's what made the first trilogy so good, and even the second trilogy, dorky as it is, has a fantastic and well mapped story to tell. This is just Disney throwing spaghetti at a wall to see what sticks and hoping that ""Star Wars"" fans are so loyal to the franchise that they'll throw their money at any garbage as long as the ""Star Wars"" logo is attached to it.Grade: C"

51,tt0120915,Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,,"Star Wars Ep. 1: The Phantom Menace (1999) * 1/2 (out of 4) I thought the first three films were great even though I'm certainly not a fan or anything but this sucker here was just horrid all around. Thankfully the thing got bad enough to where I could just sit back and laugh at it but without the laughs and the nice pod chase then this here would have been without any merit. The dialogue was insane and it's hard to believe any of the actors kept a straight face but I'd go also say the poor dialogue made most of the cast just milk their performance. All of the ""stars"" in this film have given plenty of great performances throughout their careers but they're all bad here, especially Portman who's on of my favorite actresses. Whoever played the young Luke was also terrific but at least I got several laughs out of him."
52,tt0120915,Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,2.0,"The biggest cinematic event of 1999, George Lucas' film was eagerly awaited by literally millions of fans, young and old, for over a year before it finally arrived in the cinemas and, as expected, broke box office records. Everyone looked forward to the film, and you can't blame them, as the first three Star Wars films were all box office hits, milestones in special effects, and all rightly deserve their classic status. As the writing appeared on screen and the music began, I was fidgeting in my cinema seat with excitement. Unfortunately, Lucas appears to have somewhat lost his touch in the twenty years which have separated the films, and this prequel is nowhere near as good as it could have been.The faults are obvious, and, to a degree, predictable. Predictably enough, there is a visual overload of special effects overwhelming the screen at every opportunity, so many in fact that you soon become immune to the initial amazement of seeing how good they are. They can't be faulted. Every year, CGI just keeps getting better and better and more and more realistic, and the special effects are great. They're not realistic at all, but they look good. I mean, this is the first film to have a computer image as a central character (which freely mingles with the human actors) and in which you really come to forget that it's not real, and you treat it with exactly the same feelings as the actors on screen. Ja Ja Biggs is annoying, yes, but in that respect he is human too. Sadly with so many visual effects bombarding us they quickly become boring, and you realise that the film is desperately in need of some characterisation - a major failing which totally ruins Lucas' intended effect.In the first three films we cared about and felt for Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and all the others, but you don't give a damn in this epic where all the actors do is interact with their computer surroundings and accomplices. And in this way the film is typical of late '90s cinema, where special effects bonanzas like VOLCANO and MEN IN BLACK are full of great FX but little else. In the extended chase sequence in the middle of the film, you get the feel you're watching a video game rather than an actual film, with it looking so unrealistic. Another major fault of the film is that the plot is rather boring. For three quarters of the film not a lot happens, with people talking about tax interspersed with some lame fight scenes, and it's not until the last half an hour that things really hot up and get exciting. I don't know about you, but I never expected Star Wars to be boring. Most scenes appear to be rehashes of moments from the original trilogy, but they're never as interesting, partly because as I mentioned before you don't actually give two hoots about any of the characters.Speaking of the characters leads me on to the actors, obviously an ensemble cast picked from the crème of top Hollywood stars, leading me to wonder if they were in fact picked for their looks rather than their acting ability. For instance, Natalie Portman looks very fragile as the Queen of Naboo, but her acting is barely existent and she is given little to do. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are top billed as the main stars, but they are given woefully little to do other than walk around, and occasionally jump about a bit. Of the two, Neeson is by far the best, and also my favourite actor in this film. Jake Lloyd appears as a young Darth Vader, but it's difficult to imagine him being remotely threatening, more like a typical American child actor, marginally less whiny than most. Samuel Jackson is given only a couple of scenes, but hopefully he will appear more in the next two films, while Brian Blessed lends only his voice to a comic relief alien character. However it's the returning actors from the original who are the most interesting, and it's great to see Kenny Baker and Anthony Daniels reprise their famous roles as the Laurel and Hardy of the robot world, R2D2 and C3PO. They appear only briefly. Ian McDiarmid reprises his role as the evil Emperor from Return of the Jedi, and is brilliant as Senator Palpatine, the stern but good leader. McDiarmid is very authoritative and successfully mixes his allegiance to good in the role with hints of the powerful, evil figure that he will eventually become.The action sequences in this film range from the mediocre to the poor. The space battles offer nothing new and, to be honest, they were done much better and with more finesse twenty years ago. The light sabre fights with the robots also become boring very quickly, and there are only so many different ways McGregor and Neeson can kill their CGI nemesis. The action happens all very quickly and efficiently, but lacks any sparkle or excitement, or indeed adrenaline. The special effects, probably some of the best CGI I have ever seen in an underwater sequence with gigantic fish attacking a small craft are quite realistic, but I don't think the filmmakers have realised that you need something more than that yet. The music is also very average and the classic themes we all recognise from the first trilogy are sorely underused. The Phantom Menace is disappointing, and nowhere near as good as the originals, but I suppose the mere status of it makes it required viewing, even if it really is this bad. All I can say is that it makes me feel dubious about the next film. Let's hope it's more impressive than this misfiring, below average attempt to rekindle the - much-missed - epic flame."
53,tt0120915,Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.0,"The Trade Federation has a blockade against the planet Naboo. The Republic sends Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) to negotiate an end. However, Sith Lord Darth Sidious orders the Federation to attack. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan encounter Gungan outcast Jar Jar Binks on Naboo. They rescue Queen Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman). Their ship is forced to land on the planet Tatooine where they meet slave child Anakin Skywalker.The general assessment is that this is a CGI masterpiece but there are many problems. Even its' biggest detractors can't deny that this movie has revolutionary CGI. It is a wonderland of computer magic. On the other hand, the acting is pretty bad even without Jar Jar. The exception is Liam Neeson. The man is an acting beast. Ewan McGregor is fine but Natalie Portman is lost. I have nothing against Jake Lloyd. The kid is expected to be too much and he can't deliver.Jar Jar is horrible. The Gungan leader is even worst. It is a poor gamble from the start but then it gets worst. The kiddie humor is all Lucas and it's all bad. Lucas has absolute power and he uses it to aim this at the younglings. Even in the terrific pod race, the kiddie humor infects the thrills. The humor is bad. On the opposite end, the good is the villain Darth Maul. He's a cool character. However, even that is done wrong in the end when both Darth Maul and Qui-Gon are gone from the prequels. By far, they are the best characters and Lucas sends them packing early in the prequel trilogy.Then there is the force. I never needed it to be explained. That's why the midi-chlorians are so awkward. None of that is needed. There is also the immaculate conception which is even more awkward. One can get inspiration from religion but Lucas shouldn't have copied from religion. There is also a general lack of tension throughout the movie. The expositions and conversations are stale. This is a minor disappointment."

55,tt0120915,Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.0,"""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" is an American fantasy/sci-fi movie from 17 years ago. It is the fourth film in George Lucas' Star Wars franchise and the first chronologically. The cast includes quite a couple famous names: Natalie Portman, Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley, Terence Stamp, Ewan McGregor and others and they all (more or less) shine in their roles. Unfortunately, one of the major characters is played by a child actor named Jake Lloyd, who was pretty unbearable. It was so obvious how he tried so hard to be on par with all these more experienced actors and he failed miserably. The sad thing is that, despite his age, he was not new to the industry at all, had played with other stars before, so he should really know that sometimes subtlety is the key. Instead, he went full ham for most of his performance and I blame him that this has not become a better film, but also writer-director George Lucas that he did not cast a more talented kid and that he did not tell Lloyd to lay low.This pretty long film here (135 minutes) was nominated for 3 Academy Awards, but lost all of them to ""The Matrix"". This pretty much describes the 1999 Star Wars movie perfectly. It is a good watch in terms of visuals and sound, but it is nowhere near as memorable as it could have been in terms of the story. Jar Jar Binks was the major non-human character in here and he was included solely for comedic purpose, but it was all pretty embarrassing. Maybe they should have kept him from being able to speak in the tradition of the old non-human characters. Still, there are a couple good moments in terms of the story too. I personally believe it is always brave when filmmakers are not scared of letting major characters die. It can go wrong for sure, but it also can go very right if it makes sense in the grand scheme of things.As a whole, ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" certainly does not deliver in every area it attempted to, but it has its good sides too and overall, I personally thought there was more good than bad here and (apart from Lloyd), there was also no very bad luckily. Neeson and Portman brought some nice depth to their characters. McGregor was fairly forgettable unfortunately. I recommend checking this one out. It is not considerably better or worse than the old films or the new one. Then again, I am not the greatest sci-fi buff and certainly not a major Star Wars fan in general, so the best may be if you decide for yourself and check this one out. I recommend it. But not with passion."

58,tt0120915,Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,5.0,"Not only to write a comment about movies like this one (because many love them, at least as many as that loathes them), but especially and more importantly for George Lucas to make this movie. It's one of the damned if you do, damned if you don't situations, you wouldn't like to be a part of! So even if I don't think this is a great movie (CG is very good here too, although you might be distracted from CG characters if you've seen them as Muppets, in previous films, such as Yoda), the Saga had to start somehow. And because the pressure was so high and many people didn't think it delivered, they looked for a culprit! And they found themselves one in the (CG) face of one Jar Jar Binks. He's an easy target indeed, but was invented for family value only. Still Lucas took the (Jar Jar) criticism seriously in his next installments ... Chewbacca he wasn't!"
59,tt0120915,Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,8.0,"""The Phantom Menace"" registers the lowest in fan appreciation of all the films in the Star Wars franchise. Fair enough, one of the six had to just through simple math. But with a few exceptions, I thought the film held up rather well as the introduction to the Darth Vader mythos. Understanding that George Lucas' epic saga had to begin somewhere, it's not all that unbelievable that the story should begin the way it did in Episode I, with the portrayal of Anakin Skywalker as a precocious young lad with a fascination for mechanics and pod-racing. Which brings me to one of the first criticisms of 'Menace', that Anakin (Jake Lloyd) wasn't menacing enough, or exhibit a touch of evil that would develop into a Sith characteristic. Listen, if you're looking for ""The Omen"", then go watch ""The Omen"". Though he was born into slavery, Anakin appeared to have been brought up as a solid, well rounded individual by his mother (Pernilla August), and even though surrounded by petty thieves and cutthroats, was able to keep a level head on his shoulders. As for Lloyd's acting ability, it seemed to me that he maintained a level of self confidence and character throughout the story, which is all anyone could ask given the pressure that the notoriety of the role would bring.Second on the hit list for many nay sayers is the introduction of the midi-chlorians. I'd have to agree that this is somewhat troublesome, particularly in light of Obi-Wan Kenobi's explanation of The Force to Luke Skywalker in the original Star Wars film. Still, this doesn't have to be a tremendous distraction from the plot. Modern day scientists are attempting to discover a link between religious faith and genetics, so on that level, one might consider that Anakin's high midi-chlorian count gave him a unique advantage, one that surfaced in his ability to anticipate his next move in a stressful situation, a la the great pod race.OK, so what about Jar Jar. For those paying attention, Jar Jar was a Gungan, a warrior people. Yet every race or society has its' misfits, those that stand apart from the mainstream yet can be accepted by that society as someone unique and with abilities that recommend them for a larger role in life. I'll have to admit that the character made a lot more sense to me while viewing the movie with sub-titles turned on. Would Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan have been better off if they had found a more 'acceptable' partner? Chances are that a more citizen-like Gungan would have left the Jedi Knights to fend for themselves.So what was my sit up and take notice moment? I'd have to say the 'virgin birth' explanation given to Qui-Gon (Liam Neeson) caused me to roll my eyes both times I've viewed the film. Comparisons to a Messianic figure just didn't quite work for me, even if the scene played out quickly and was never brought up again.Aside from the pod race and the light saber battle that everyone seems to mention as highlights of the story, the scene that impressed me with it's intimation of the vastness of the galaxy was the one in the Senate chamber where Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) pleaded her case for Naboo against the Trade Federation. That was so much more effective than say, a televised appearance of the President before both houses of Congress. One immediately got a sense of the infinity of outer space and what it would take to assemble a representative body from the far corners of the universe. As for getting around to a meaningful vote - that would probably take a Jedi mind trick, or at least a Sith one.I guess what I'm saying is that there's a lot more going on in ""The Phantom Menace"" than a lot of casual viewers and even purported Star Wars fans are seeing. The prelude to the next two chapters is being established without much malice aforethought because there will be plenty enough of that when the time comes. For now, it's a time of innocence and fun for a novice whose turn to the Dark Side will progress with light speed when conditions deem it."
60,tt0120915,Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,5.0,"OK, so ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" was a big letdown for us all. Apparently, most people even understood the plot when it came out. It wasn't until I listened to ""Weird"" Al Yankovic's song ""The Saga Begins"" - the ""American Pie"" spoof - on his album ""Running with Scissors"" that I understood the plot.But overall, it seems that if this happens before the original trilogy, then the technology should be less sophisticated, not more. Oh well. C'est la vie. It was interesting seeing people like Liam Neeson, Samuel L. Jackson, and Christopher Lee co-starring in a movie after all these years. This may sound weird to everyone, but my favorite character was Jar Jar Binks; why did everyone think that he sounded Jamaican? I thought that he sounded Cajun.So that's my take on everything here."
61,tt0120915,Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,5.0,"After the unexpected success of the three original films, Razzie nominated George Lucas knew that one day he would have to make the prequels (the old films being episodes IV, V and VI). So this is the first of the new prequels leading to the story of how Anakin Skywalker became Lord Darth Vader. Basically Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice Obi-Won Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) are trying to restore some order in the galaxy after the villains have started a battle, because of taxation. Along the journey they help Queen Padmé Naberrie Amidala (Natalie Portman), meet 10-year-old Anakin (Razzie nominated Jake Lloyd) who wins a pod race for them to get money to fix their ship, have many political discussions both about the war and Anakin's future, and have a war with the Gungans, droid armies and fighter pilots. Also starring Pernilla August as Shmi Skywalker, The Muppets' Frank Oz (aka Miss Piggy and Fozzie Bear) as Yoda (still a puppet, till the next two), Ian McDiarmid as Senator Palpatine/Darth Sidius, Ray Park as Darth Maul, Razzie winning Ahmed Best as Jar Jar Binks, Anthony Daniels as an uncovered C-3PO, Kenny Baker as R2-D2, Terence Stamp as Supreme Chancellor Valorum, Brian Blessed as Boss Nass, Celia Imrie as Fighter Pilot Bravo 5, Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu, Keira Knightley as Sabé and twice Razzie nominated Sofia Coppola as Saché. This along with the other two are never going to be as good for story, dialogue (which is ridiculous) or 'magic' as the originals, but the special effects are never disappointing. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Sound, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Special Visual Effects and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Razzie for Worst Picture, Worst Screenplay and Worst Screen Couple for Lloyd and Portman. Samuel L. Jackson was number 11, and Ewan McGregor number 9 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Liam Neeson was number 15, and McGregor number 2 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, Star Wars was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and the film was number 28 on The Ultimate Film.

63,tt0120915,Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.0,"Like many people who watched and loved the original films when I saw them at the cinema as a child and teenager I was excited when I learnt that the prequels were going to be made. Of course no film could live up to the expectation especially as I watched it as an adult not as an awestruck ten year old. This isn't to say the film was as bad as some reviews suggest, I still enjoyed it despite its faults.The story begins with two Jedi knights, Qui-Gon Jinn and a young Obi-Wan Kenobi going to negotiate in an apparently minor trade dispute involving the blockade of the planet of Naboo. It becomes clear that something far more serious is afoot when instead of negotiating the Trade Federation attempt to kill the two Jedi. They however escape to the planet below by stowing away on the Federation's ships that are landing a droid army there. Here they meet a strange alien by the name of Jar-Jar Binks, as they save his life he is obliged to help them, he does this by first leading them to the underwater Gungan city then through the planet's water filled core to find the ruler of the local human population. The ruler in question is the young Queen Amidala whom they rescue along with her entourage. Unfortunately for them their ship is damaged so they can't fly to the capital but are instead forced to land on the desert planet Tatooine in order to find spare parts.Here they meet a young boy called Anakin Skywalker who is a slave belonging to an alien that has the required parts, unfortunately they don't have the funds required. They do however learn that Anakin has built a pod-racer and is quite a good pilot so have a wager on an upcoming race to earn the parts and Anakin's freedom. While on Tatoonine Queen Amidala's handmaiden Padmé befriends young Anakin and Qui-Gon begins to suspect that the boy is the person spoken of in their prophesies as the force is so strong in him.Once the race has been won they return to the capital but not before encountering a strange warrior called Darth Maul who nearly defeats the Jedi. Unfortunately once back in the capital they can't persuade the senate to take action to protect Naboo so return to fight the Federation along with the Gungan army. Here the two Jedi must confront Darth Maul once again and young Anakin ends up in the middle of a battle above the planet.The story isn't without flaws and quite a bit of the dialogue is a bit poor but it looks pretty good and it isn't the actors best work they are still good actors. The CGI is pretty good although in some scenes it is starting to show its age but if one doesn't look too closely that isn't a problem. It was a shame that we didn't get to see more of Darth Maul, all the advertising prior to the films release suggested he would be a more important character so I was expecting him to have a role similar to that of Darth Vader in the original film. The infamous Jar-Jar Binks, the comedy relief character is somewhat annoying for an adult viewer but I suspect children, who the film is primarily aimed at, will like him. I think it would have been better if George Lucas had got somebody else to write the screen play and direct as these don't seem to be his strong points, this could have been so much better.I wouldn't recommend this film to everybody but I'm sure it would appeal to young boys, I know my nephew couldn't get enough of it when it came out on video when he was three."

This one came out 22 years after the first ""Star Wars"" movie. It attempts to show the development of the characters we saw in the others. AFAIAC, they should have just skipped this one. What we originally knew as the ""Star Wars Trilogy"" will forever be the real Star Wars movies.Liam Neeson and the others do credible jobs, but they have no where the interest and excitement that Harrison Ford and his cronies had. I didn't fully appreciate back then what a prototypical ""action hero"" Ford was. Without Darth Vader, without the Wookie, without Han Solo, without Princess Leia, without Chewbacca, without the grown up Luke Skywalker, and without the wise old Ben Kenobi, this is just an ordinary action movie. Like they say, ""you can never go back!"""
67,tt0120915,Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,5.0,"Episode 1 is a good film, but it is by no means the best of the series. True, this is technically the first of the series (or the fourth), and it does set a good stage for the other films, but this film does have it's flaws. 1- Jar Jar Binks! What drug was Lucas on when he created that character. I haven't seen a character (a comic relief one at that) as bad as that since Godzilla in 98. And 2- It's not as heart warming as the last ones, the other films seemed to at least have a good sense of love in it. Yet, that doesn't stop writer/director George Lucas form having plenty of fun (including with spectacular visual effects that make up most of the movie) including a terrific Pod Race sequence, great fight scenes, and cool battle action. But it does prove one thing, that like episode 4, the episode following it (like the dark episiode 5- The Empire Strikes Back) will be dark and good. Good entertainment anyway."

Definitely not sluggish and sometimes taxing the viewers intelligence. Some scenes seem like Lucas himself ran out of imagination. All this said...this prequel of the original STAR WARS trilogy does have enough merit to stand on its own and is no less visually stunning. A Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn(Liam Neeson)and his young apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi(Ewan McGregor)travel to the small peaceful planet of Naboo to assist the beautiful Queen Amidala(Natalie Portman)in her efforts to bypass any disputed control by the Trade Federation on the ready to blockade her planet. After a battle the Jedis and popular Queen Amidala make their way to the planet of Tattooine where they come across a young slave boy named Anakin Skywalker(Jake Lloyd)who appears to be empowered with the FORCE and possibly the holder of enough information to thwart the evil influence of a challenging pursuit by the Federation and evil Dark Lord, Darth Maul(Ray Park). I really enjoyed the final saber duel. Really the one and only thing I disliked is the stupid character Jar Jar Binks.

70,tt0120915,Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,9.0,"In 1977, George Lucas released Star Wars, the ultimate sci-fi popcorn flick-turned-pop-culture myth machine. It quickly became the biggest money-making film of all time and changed the shape of the film industry. After two successful sequels that extended the story of the first film, Lucas took some time off to produce movies for others, with mixed success. In 1999, Lucas returned to the Star Wars saga with a new approach -- instead of picking up where Return of the Jedi left off, Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace would be the first of a trilogy of stories to trace what happened in the intergalactic saga before the first film began.Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace is a space film written and directed by George Lucas. It is the fourth film to be released in the Star Wars saga, as the first of a three-part prequel to the original Star Wars trilogy, as well as the first film in the saga in terms of story chronology. The Phantom Menace was also Lucas' first product as a film director after 22 years, and only his fourth overall with the Star Wars films.Here, Obi-Wan Kenobi is a young apprentice Jedi knight under the tutelage of Qui-Gon Jinn; Anakin Skywalker, who will later father Luke Skywalker and become known as Darth Vader, is just a nine-year-old boy. When the Trade Federation cuts off all routes to the planet Naboo, Qui- Gon and Obi-Wan are assigned to settle the matter, but when they arrive on Naboo they are brought to Amidala, the Naboo queen, by a friendly but opportunistic Gungan named Jar Jar. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan plan to escort Amidala to a meeting of Republic leaders in Coruscant, but trouble with their spacecraft strands them on the planet Tatooine, where Qui-Gon meets Anakin, the slave of a scrap dealer. Qui-Gon is soon convinced that the boy could be the leader the Jedis have been searching for, and he begins bargaining for his freedom and teaching the boy the lessons of the Force. Despite a shaky start and the presence of questionable elements throughout, by the time it arrives at its finale The Phantom Menace has won its place alongside the original Star Wars trilogy.The special effects are some of the most dazzling and amazing ever seen on the big screen. In addition, the acting is excellent.Although the visuals are indeed eye-popping, the viewer may find no vested emotional tie to either story or characters which makes it fall short from the other Star Wars film.It simply lacks a lot of the heart the original series embraced.But despite of its setbacks,this movie still is a great view since it will provide great entertainment and satisfaction."

74,tt0120915,Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,7.0,"Hmmm. I watched this again recently hoping that it wasn't as mediocre as I had thought first time around. Sadly, not. The opening scenes are great: a good fight with lots of action and lightsabres; then it descends into a sort of cross between ""Ben Hur"" and ""The Golden Child"" with some pantomime thrown in too. The film is clearly designed to be part one of another trilogy and as such spends way too much of its time setting the scenes and establishing the characters for the films to follow - we do start to get a sense of the evil ""Palpatine"" and it looks spectacular, but it is basically pretty empty and soulless with a very weak storyline."
75,tt0121766,Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,4.0,"Well, at the outset, this film already lost a point or two from me since it, once again, features that nauseating character ""Jar-Jar"". While some of my friends pointed out that he wasn't in this film as much as in the previous two, having him in the film at all makes me hate the movie. Why George Lucas dogmatically refused to admit that this character was a HUGE marketing mistake AND that he even went back to the earlier films to add him into irrelevant scenes for the DVD release is beyond me. Obviously, he is NOT a person who can admit he was wrong! All the unpurchased Jar-Jar merchandise sitting on store shelves as well as all the ""I hate Jar-Jar"" web sites SHOULD be an indication that he is less than loved by the public!Now apart from that, the film is very lovely to look at--with great special effects and tons of eye candy for the viewer. You can't fault the action. However, I also think this film was designed for dumb people, as literate and non-cerebrally impaired people will notice that the dialog is simply one cliché after another. I know this may sound arrogant, but George Lucas wrote horrid dialog. When it comes to logic, this is also often missing from the film. I felt like screaming during at the scene where Vader is battling in a volcano--yet he doesn't break a sweat and only is injured when he eventually falls into the molten goo. He and his nemesis would have been vaporized long before touching the stuff and also would have choked to death on noxious fumes. Apparently this volcano only releases oxygen and is only hot to the touch! Additionally, while little kids loved it, when Yoda does his ninja-Jedi fighting scene, I was horrified at its stupidity. It was simply intended to entertain the lowest common denominator in the theater and was completely out of character. Many adults, I assume, cringed during these awful scenes.When I compare this film to the earlier films, I am left saddened. Couldn't they have found a better script or at least edited it before filming began? Or perhaps gotten a professional script writer. What a disappointment."

77,tt0121766,Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,6.0,"Finally, the film all Star Wars fans have been waiting for, and really the only one of the three prequels that's worth watching: Revenge of the Sith is a dream come true, offering spectacle and excitement that is far more akin to the original trilogy than the flabby, pointless prequels which followed it. This is the only story, with the only characters worth bothering with. The action-packed plot line involves the betrayal and death of the Jedi council in a surprisingly poignant overview, and of course there are tons of space battles and light saber fights to liven things up along the way.Hayden Christensen has developed his range remarkably since the last movie and, whilst not superb here, he's certainly adequate. McGregor I'm less happy with, as his Kenobi is lightweight and far from Alec Guinness's calibre, but he'll do. Revenge of the Sith is the first film that really grapples with the idea of the Dark Side, and it makes for interesting viewing; Lucas hasn't excelled himself but he's concocted a lightweight popcorn movie with some fabulous moments. The trio of bad guys seen here are good, although Christopher Lee is barely on screen, only popping up so he can get bumped off in a graphically nasty interlude. Grievous is a fine animated creation whilst McDiarmid finally gets a chance to sink his teeth into what has been a boring side-character for two movies this is the one where he turns into the Emperor we all know and love from Return of the Jedi, and his inclusion is a corker.The film has many standout moments but the highlights have to be the Kenobi vs. Grievous showdown – complete with droids and monsters everywhere – and the execution of the Jedis. Samuel L. Jackson has a very cool showdown with McDiarmid which is worth the admission price alone. The Skywalker/Kenobi light saber fight on the lava planet goes on for far too long, and is quite ridiculous – Lucas seems to take a childish glee in teasing the the viewer by putting the two into impossible situations only for them to keep escaping over and over again – but the epilogue, in which Darth Vader returns, is brilliant and worth the wait. Add to this a high-cheekboned actor who portrays a young Peter Cushing, some graphically nasty moments for the most violent film of the six, and you have an engaging, entertaining action romp that finally nears the quality of the original three films."

83,tt0121766,Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,10.0,"And so, the Star Wars saga comes full circle, with the final pieces of the intergalactic puzzle falling into place. Of course we knew the major elements about to be revealed, but to see it done so effectively is a tribute to the epic story telling genius of creator George Lucas.I recall the controversy about the working name of Star Wars Episode VI - Revenge of the Jedi. Back in 1983 it was thought that the title suggested too much violence, and not a fitting description for the forces of the ""good"" side. But for this installment of the series, ""Revenge of the Sith"" is certainly fitting, as Anakin Skywalker's turn to the Dark Side under his master Chancellor Palpatine/Darth Sidious is fraught with betrayal, violence and murder.The movie opens with the same grand scope as previous films in the series, but taken to even more cosmic proportion with jaw dropping sequences of outer space grandeur. Fleet cruisers jet by gigantic space stations as naturally as city traffic. Fans of space opera will no doubt thrill to the spectacle of color and sound offered here.The relationship between Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) and Anakin (Hayden Christensen) is handled intelligently, even as the young Jedi is manipulated and convinced by Palpatine that the future of the Republic belongs in his own capable hands as dictator of the galaxy. Padme's refusal to side with her husband is of course the turning point in the marriage, with the safety of her newborns of uppermost importance. I guess what bothers me most about the movie though is the reason given for Padme's death during childbirth, having lost her will to live. This is not the character we saw in the prior two films; after all, she had the regal bearing and demeanor of a queen, and the shrewd tenacity of a planetary senator. To just ""give up"", even under the horrendous circumstances of Anakin's turn is a situation not adequately dealt with in the movie.General Grievous - great name for the robotic leader of the clone army, but what's with the persistent cough. Perhaps it made him seem more vile, but why would a robot suffer a human malady? His running battle with Obi Wan Kenobi was a highlight of the movie.Christopher Lee - now there's an actor who's first film credit dates back to 1948, and who's come a long way from the horror remakes of the 1950's and 60's, to star in the two major epic movie sagas of our time - ""The Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy, and episodes II and III of the current Star Wars series. It seems he only gets better with age, as his portrayal of Count Dooku/Darth Tyranus shows.Ewan McGregor does an excellent job of preparing us for the Alec Guiness version of the Jedi Master of ""Star Wars: A New Hope"". When he appears in the latter part of the film in the straw colored robe, I immediately thought of the scene in Episode IV when Princess Leia's hologram image reaches out for ""Obi Wan Kenobi - you're my only hope"".Following the death of Jedi Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson), Darth Sidious gives the command to wipe out all the rest of the Jedi Council. Was it intentional, or merely coincidental, that the orders were carried out in the fashion of a sci-fi ""Godfather""? Only Obi Wan and Yoda had the wisdom and foresight to condemn themselves to exile so they could fight another day. Kenobi's mission to Tatooine to deliver the newborn Skywalker was a stroke of storytelling magic, bringing his personal adventure in the Star Wars saga full circle as well.But can the Star Wars story EVER end? The franchise lives on in a myriad of media, and it seems that there are even more adventures and characters whose stories must be told. One can only hope that the creativity and ingenuity begun by George Lucas in 1977 continues to live on in the hyper space region of entertainment known as The Star Wars Universe."
84,tt0121766,Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,7.0,"You may have heard how ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" ends, so I'll just talk about a few aspects. The line ""Either you're with me or you're my enemy"" sounds a lot like ""Either you're with us or you're with the terrorists"" (although George Lucas wrote the script before September 11). But I would have said a long time ago that George W. Bush is basically the same as Darth Vader.In some way, maybe the movie is sort of a video game, but that one line made it really good. Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Ian McDiarmid, Samuel L. Jackson, and Christopher Lee certainly do the best with their roles. Acceptable for what it is."
85,tt0121766,Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,6.0,"As the Clone Wars near an end, the Sith Lord Darth Sidious steps out of the shadows, at which time Anakin succumbs to his emotions, becoming Darth Vader and putting his relationships with Obi-Wan and Padme at risk.This film has far too much reliance on special effects and CG. Even the fire is obviously computer-rendered. Most of the action scenes are completely fake and even one of the main bad guys (Grievous) is clearly a cartoon. How can I take this seriously, especially when they were able to create better-looking aliens back in the 1970s? To be fair, though, this is the best of the second (or first?) trilogy, because it finally catches us up. We knew what had to happen because these were prequels, and the arc is effectively handled."
86,tt0121766,Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,5.0,"The final episode of both the prequels and the entire saga (28 years since the release) is the darkest of them all, from writer/director/creator George Lucas. It was also the most anticipated with the revelation of how Anakin Skywalker (Razzie winning Hayden Christensen) joined the Dark Side, and became Darth Vader. It is war, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) was kidnapped by Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), and Anakin listened to the Chancellor's order to kill him, which is not the Jedi way. Obi-Won Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) is on the search for General Grievous, the other person suspected as being the Emperor's servant. Anakin meanwhile is having complications with his wife, Padmé (Natalie Portman) who is pregnant, and eventually, as he turns, starts dying, because of his anger. He is also assigned to keep an eye and spy on Chancellor, but when he finds out he is the Emperor he does not do what Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) said and kill him, and he ends up striking him, and letting the now disfigured Emperor killing him with his lightning power. Anakin was seduced by it, and now he gives in to the Dark Side and is now named Darth Vader, and he follows all the Emperor's orders to kill all Jedi threat, even the children! Towards the end, Obi-Won discovers his turn to the Dark Side, and their light sabre fight on the volcanic planet is extraordinary, and when it is concluded Anakin is burned, and Obi-Won just leaves him. This is the pinnacle moment when (after found by the Emperor), Padmé gives birth to the twin babies, Luke and Leia, before dying from Anakin's anger, and Anakin has become Darth Vader with the mask and helmet, because he couldn't breathe properly. Also starring Jimmy Smits as Senator Bail Organa, The Muppets' Frank Oz (aka Miss Piggy and Fozzie Bear) as Yoda (now computer generated), Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, Ahmed Best as Jar Jar Binks, Kenny Baker as R2-D2, Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca and James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader. This film basically explains everything about the future and ends all questions for the original trilogy. This along with the other two are never going to be as good for story, dialogue (which is ridiculous) or 'magic' as the originals, but the special effects are never disappointing. Samuel L. Jackson was number 11, and Ewan McGregor number 9 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and McGregor was number 2 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and Star Wars was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Worth watching!"
87,tt0121766,Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,9.0,"I was never one of the millions of Star Wars groupies. I enjoyed the films, except for Attack Of The Clones, but wasn't a huge fan. Having seen the first five, I eventually got around to checking out this last one, if for no other reason than curiosity. Wow, it changed my whole outlook.I cannot believe how impressed I was with this film, how well the writers wrapped up the whole saga and put all the pieces together. This was an excellent film, the best of the entire series. It inspired me to buy the latest DVD set which had the first three movies released and then reacquire the Clones film to complete my DVD collection of it.I'm writing this review months after seeing ""Sith."" so it's just a few general thoughts. I remember thinking, after watching the wild opening, that this was going to be another one of the modern-day action films with too much action....but it settled down and wasn't vastly overdone in that area, although it could have toned it down a bit. Better than the action or special effects was simply the way the writers tied everything up, how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader, and his son wound up being the hero ""Luke"" that we saw in those early episodes of the 1970s and 1980s. The special effects were, of course, top-notch. When you go back and see those early films you really see how far Hollywood has advanced in this area. I cannot imagine how many hours of work it took the put these storyboards and computer artwork in this film, there is so much detail. It's mind-boggling.I know a lot of fans of this series feared the writers would mess up the final but their fears were not realized: this was a super ending to a memorable saga that endured for almost 30 years amazing."
88,tt0121766,Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,7.0,"Of the three prequels this is probably the best although it does suffer from George's addiction to CGI special effects, it seems that because it is possible to have hundreds of ships in a battle he has to have hundreds even though it just looks cluttered. It also suffers some what because we know what has to happen as this is a link between the prequels and Star Wars; Obi-Wan and Yoda have to survive and Anakin has to become Darth Vader, this of course is unavoidable.The story itself is exciting enough featuring plenty of light sabre fights, the realisation that Chancellor Palpatine is in fact the Sith lord Darth Sidious and the clone army turning on the Jedi and killing most of them.The film starts with Obi Wan and Anakin having to rescue the chancellor from the evil Count Dooku and his droid henchman General Grievous. Once Anakin has beaten and disarmed Dooku the chancellor tells him to kill him as he is too dangerous, this Anakin does after some hesitation. As a ""reward"" for this the chancellor asks Anakin to be his representative on the council, he accepts the offer but is offended when the council refuse to make him a Jedi Master. While this is going on he is troubled by dreams about Padmé dying in child birth thus he becomes drawn to the chancellor when he tell him that it is possible to use the dark side of the force to prevent death. He isn't totally taken in though as when Palpatine makes it clear that he is a Sith lord he reports back to Jedi Master Mace Windu who goes to confront the Chancellor. Anakin interrupts them when it appears that Palpatine has been defeated and Windu is going to kill him, Anakin protects the chancellor who is in fact far from defeated, he kills Windu and Anakin realises he has made a mistake, strangely at this point it only takes a few words from Palpatine to get Anakin to switch allegiances and help Palpatine slaughter the Jedi so he can over through the republic and create his empire.The new emperor dispatches Anakin, now the Sith lord Darth Vader, to volcanic planet of Mustafar to kill his previous allies. Padmé follows him when she hears from Obi Wan what he has done, she confronts him and begs him to stop what he is doing so they can live a quiet life together, he however refuses saying he will overthrow the emperor so the two of them can rule the galaxy together. She is horrified at this and when Obi Wan appears from her ship, which he had stowed away on, Vader thinks Padmé has betrayed him and uses the force to choke her. This leads to the climactic battle between Vader and Obi-Wan which is inter-cut with a simultaneous battle between Yoda and the emperor. It isn't giving too much away to say that Vader ends up badly maimed and burn and the emperor beats Yoda who manages to escape. The film ends with the birth of Luke and Leah and the ""rebirth"" of Anakin as the black-helmeted Darth Vader we know from the original films.If you watched the first to prequels I'm sure you'll enjoy this too although some scenes may be a bit frightening for younger viewers. As with the other prequels the dialogue was pretty hammy so even quality actors like Ewan McGregor can't make it sound good. The way many of the battles took place at the same time as others and we kept switching between them was frustrating, instead of increasing the excitement it seemed to reduce it. Ian McDiarmid comes off best as he clearly knows he is playing a pantomime villain and acts accordingly, an option not really available to those playing the heroes of the story. Like the other prequels I think it would have been better if George had just written the basic story then got somebody else to write the screenplay with better dialogue and somebody else to direct who was more interested in actors than ""cool"" CGI."

But that brought me to another thought, namely that maybe 6 movies on the same theme is just too much. Oh! I enjoyed this one, a bit more than episodes 1 and 2 (which were really the 4th and 5th made), and at the end it ties up all loose ends to lead into what we know as the original Star Wars, which is now known as episode 4 but one that most saw initially over 20 years ago. The actors are good. I had harsh criticism for Natalie Portman in Episode 2, for wooden acting, but she was much better here. I always like Ewan McGregor. But I can never find Hayden Christensen as a credible Anakin Skywalker. Still, overall a very nice final installment but episode 3, and with good light saber fights.SPOILERS. The Sith want revenge, they recognize young Skywalker as something special, he is seduced to the dark side, has a big showdown with his friend and mentor Ob-Wan Kenobi, but Obi-Wan gets the upper hand on a volcanic planet, Anakin loses an arm and both lower legs, and burned badly at the edge of lava flow, appears to be dying. But Sith arrive just in time to pull him out and save him, but he has to be fitted with the costume we recognize as Darth Vader. His wife (Portman) knowing he has turned to the dark side loses her will to live and dies during childbirth, having twins Luke and Leiah, who are separated for their safety and raised by surrogate parents, on two different planets. Which all sets up the original Star Wars movie, now known as Episode 4.Ewan McGregor .... Obi-Wan Kenobi Natalie Portman .... Padmé Hayden Christensen .... Anakin Skywalker Ian McDiarmid ....

97,tt0121766,Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,10.0,"George Lucas draws the Star Wars film series to a close with this dark sci-fi adventure which sets the stage for the events of the first film and brings the saga full circle.Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is an epic space opera film written and directed by George Lucas. It is the sixth and final film released in the Star Wars saga and the third in terms of the series' internal chronology.The film takes place three years after the onset of the Clone Wars. The Jedi Knights are spread out across the galaxy leading a massive clone army in the war against the Separatists.After a fierce battle in which Obi-Wan and Anakin join Republic forces to help free Chancellor Palpatine from the evil Count Dooku and his minions, Anakin is drawn into Palpatine's confidence. Palpatine has designs on expanding his rule, and with this in mind he plants seeds of doubt in Anakin's mind about the strength and wisdom of the Jedis. Anakin is already in a quandary about how to reveal to others the news of his secret marriage to Padmé Amidala now that she is pregnant, and visions which foretell her death in childbirth weigh heavy on his mind. As Anakin finds himself used by both the Jedis and the Republic for their own purposes -- particularly after Mace Windu expresses his distrust of the young Jedi - - he turns more and more to the Force for help, but begins to succumb to the temptations of its dark side. The Jedi Council dispatches Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to eliminate the evil General Grievous, leader of the Separatist Army. Meanwhile, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, separated from Kenobi, his former master, grows close to Palpatine, the Chancellor of the Galactic Republic and, unbeknown to the public, a Sith Lord. Their deepening friendship proves dangerous for the Jedi Order, the galaxy, and Anakin himself, who inevitably succumbs to the Dark Side of the Force and becomes Darth Vader.A grave and vigorous popular entertainment, a picture that regains and sustains that Lucas had dreamed up a long time ago, in a movie industry that seems far, far away.They did really save the best for last.Many of the Star Wars series regulars returned for Revenge of the Sith, including Frank Oz as the voice of Yoda, Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, Kenny Baker as R2-D2, and Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca.Sith succeeds in providing a satisfying ending to the films as Anakin Skywalker begins his journey to the Dark Side.It was the best-looking Star Wars episode of all, if not the most exciting, most imaginative or most affecting.In summary,this sixth and final installment of George Lucas' epic space opera will please die-hard fanatics and non-believers alike -- largely due to awesome digital effects and the sheer power of the mythology wherein a relatively thoughtful story about a young man meant for greatness but corrupted by his own fear and confusion is told."

100,tt2488496,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,10.0,"I have never been a huge fan of the Star Wars films--especially after the last three films they made. Too often, in my opinion, the emphasis was merchandising cute characters to kids instead of making the best possible sci-fi film. Fortunately, now that George Lucas sold off the franchise, Disney actually has made a slightly darker and slightly more adult addition to the franchise...and I was thoroughly impressed.I really DON'T want to talk about the plot of ""The Force Awakens""-- mostly because the movie just debuted and I would prefer folks experience it themselves. However, I don't think it spoils it in any way to say that the film is a bit of the old and a bit of the new. So, folks who loved the earlier films (particularly the great ones) will be happy that the film is clearly Star Wars and has a lot of similar plot elements from the earlier movies. You also get to see some familiar faces. But there also are several new ones and they seem to have a bit more depth than usual. I particularly liked Finn (John Boyega) and Rey (Daisy Ridley)--they were not just formulaic characters and you really like and respect them.The bottom line is that the film very much kept my interest and Disney seemed much more focused on story and, especially, characterization. A thoroughly enjoyable film from start to finish."
101,tt2488496,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,9.0,"Loved the original 'Star Wars' films as a kid, still do. Especially 'Empire Strikes Back' while considering 'A New Hope' a genre landmark. Didn't think the prequel films were that bad personally, but they had a lot wrong with them and were a long way from great, especially 'Attack of the Clones'.Despite seeing 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' around the time it first came out (maybe a little after), there was a long time of being put off by the vitriolic hate it's gotten here and the practical war zone there is in order to review it (even when it was critically acclaimed). Finally mustering the courage, count me in as somebody who loved 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens'. A masterpiece? No. Better than the prequels? Absolutely, and although some may disagree this is saying a lot. The best 'Star Wars' film since 'The Return of the Jedi?' Yes.'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' is not the most original plot-wise. It has been criticised for being a re-hash of 'A New Hope', understandably. However, instead of being done in a cheap and slap-in-the-face way, it felt like an affectionate and nostalgic homage. Exemplified by bringing back major characters from the original trilogy in supporting roles. JJ Abrams, and this may be considered blasphemy, does a much better job here than he did with his 'Star Trek' reboot films, here he keeps the original spirit of the original trilogy intact while giving the film its own identity at the same time.While it certainly dazzles in spectacle and action, 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' doesn't feel too big, too noisy or too chaotic at the expense of creating memorable characters, a fun story and brains and heart. The characters are memorable with easily identifiable leads, the original trilogy characters bringing a lot of affectionate nostalgia and a well executed if not iconic (not by Darth Vader standards anyhow) villain in Kylo Ren (unpredictable and dangerous but feeling he is morally justified).The story lacks originality but more than makes up for it in energy, non-stop heart-thumping thrills and excitement, generosity, a cheerfulness that is positively space operatic, vibrant charm and a few fresh twists along the way. In many ways it is a celebration of the universe while also an expansion of it. It is sometimes sentimental but never overly so, one crucial death scene is just heart-wrenching (particularly Chewbacca's reaction) and doesn't feel like a slap in the face to the character in question.Could the villains have been better written? Ren is fine but Snoke only just about works as a character thanks to the visual effects and especially the powerfully enigmatic with a touch of vulnerability performance of Andy Serkis, other than that the character is underwritten. Also felt that Gwendoline Christie's character was unnecessary, so limited was her screen time.Visually, 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' is a triumph. It is gorgeously shot and designed with Abrams' visual storytelling shining far more here than it has in other films he's done. The special effects are a dazzling marvel. John Williams delivers yet another rousing score that has its own character but cleverly includes the well-known iconic themes from the previous films. Thank goodness that the dialogue contains little to none of the cheesiness heard in the prequels, and it even has more layers than that of the original trilogy.Acting also shines, with winning charismatic performances from John Boyega and particularly Daisy Ridley. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher still have it, while Max Von Sydow shows himself to be a master of gestures and eye contact speaking louder than words. Adam Driver is a suitably menacing Ren and Serkis makes much of his somewhat underwritten character. Oscar Isaac gives a typically strong performance.In conclusion, a great film, the best 'Star Wars' film since 'The Return of the Jedi' and one of the best of the saga too. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
102,tt2488496,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,5.0,"Unlike many moviegoers, I couldn't care less about the STAR WARS franchise these days. Sure, I grew up with the original trilogy, which I still know and love, but George Lucas single-handedly destroyed the goodwill surrounding those movies with his mishandling of the prequels. The good news is that THE FORCE AWAKENS - a genuine sequel to RETURN OF THE JEDI - is better than the prequels, but only just. Because this is a deeply flawed movie that gets ten things wrong for everything it gets right. While it's a delight to see Harrison Ford effortlessly breezing back into one of his most iconic roles, the rest of the production is a mixed bag of good and bad, of the woeful and the wonderful.Inevitably, the special effects are one of the strongest things here. The copious use of the CGI looks better than ever, and the alien planets involved in the story are all well realised. You can't fault the large-scale action sequences, which look great in high definition, and as a whole the film is a visual treat. A shame, then, that the story is so weak and a virtual retread of the first STAR WARS film, A NEW HOPE, made all those years ago. The new villains are laughable and Adam Driver's attempts at an iconic baddie along the lines of Darth Vader are quite pitiful. The starkiller stuff is as predictable as it gets, and you wonder why they couldn't go in a fresh and new direction instead of simply regurgitating what has come previously.The new characters don't fare very well either. John Boyega, who was so good in ATTACK THE BLOCK, struggles with a put-on American accent that rings hollow. Daisy Ridley is even worse: this newcomer seems to have overdosed on Keira Knightley performances, copying Knightley's style of acting throughout and feeling completely artificial as a result. All of her lines sound cheesy and wooden, and frankly I felt embarrassed watching her attempting to act alongside the more seasoned actors. It says something that the droid, BB-8, was my favourite of the new characters, given that his high 'cuteness' factor is a shamelessly manipulative attempt to endear him to audiences. Add in a non-ending of a film that merely opens the door for the next inevitable instalment, and you have an oddly hollow film that looks nice but falls apart as soon as you start picking at it."
103,tt2488496,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) *** (out of 4) I'm pretty sure every person on Earth know what the film is about and just in case you don't I'm not going to spoil anything here in regards to the plot. Yes, it's basically a reworking of A NEW HOPE with the old and new characters being brought together to go up against the Dark Side.STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS was probably the most anticipated movie in recent memory and as no shocked it turned out to be a massive hit. I predicted when I heard that it was going to be made that it would eventually become the top grossing movie ever made. It hasn't quite reached that mark as of me writing this but I'm sure it will happen. So, we know it was a massive hit but how was the actual movie? I'm not a major STAR WARS fan but this one here isn't nearly as good as episodes four through six. How could it be? With that said I must admit that I found the film to be extremely entertaining, which is all I was personally asking for. I thought J.J. Abrams did a very good job at building up the new characters and the new story while also keeping the original trilogy fans happy. I thought the screenplay was clever in how the old characters were brought into this new story and I won't complain about any of the events that happen in regards to the story.The special effects, as you'd expect, are spectacular and they certainly push the level in regards to what can be done today. The various space battles were tremendous to look at and best of all is that they feel 100% authentic and real. There wasn't a single battle where you didn't feel as if you were right there in the action and this is always a major plus. Another thing are that the robotic characters are all well-designed and manage to fit right in with the series. The film is full of wonderful action scenes and all of them are full of terrific atmosphere.Performance wise, against I'm not going to spoil anything major so all I will say is that the original three actors are all excellent in how they are used. The new people like Daisy Ridley, JOhn Boyega, Oscar Isaac and Adam Driver all are good and I think fans have a nice cast to take this series into the future. Of course, we also have Chewbacca back, which is always fun.The film does have some flaws and I think some of it is based around the humor. The film goes for a lot of humor and I thought a lot of it didn't work all that well. Ford and Chewbacca get some nice moments together but many times the jokes fell flat. I'd also say that the film ran on a tad bit too long but the ending was so wonderful that it was fun once it came. STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS is really just a set-up for what's to follow and it certainly has me excited for what comes next."

The Republic is threatened by the First Order led by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) under the control of Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). The resistance led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) is fighting the Dark Side. Finn (John Boyega) is a conflicted stormtrooper. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is a scavenger on the planet Jakku. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is the Resistance ace pilot.It has been over 30 years since the last truly good Star Wars movie. It is a great reboot and a solid repair job to the damage from the prequels. The biggest complaint seems to be that this is a repeat of A New Hope. If anything, this is pulling out scenes and references from all three originals. I have no problems with that. In fact, it's good to go back and take pages out of the original trilogy. Even the force is explained more in the traditional way. However, this is not a simple repeat. The new characters are tremendous. John Boyega and Daisy Ridley are amazing additions. He's an interesting character and I love their initial meeting. I love him keep grabbing her hand. There are some minor problems but they're too minor to mention especially considering the spoilers. I rank 'The Empire Strikes Back' (1980) the best, 'A New Hope' (1977) second, and I may squeeze 'The Force Awakens' slightly ahead of 'Return of the Jedi' (1983). Forget the prequels.P.S.

105,tt2488496,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,7.0,"I saw Quentin Tarentino on Stephen Colbert the other night. He pointed out that no matter what movie he's gone to, he always remembers that it is still a movie...that he never falls into the spell to where he forgets. People say they do. He doesn't. I deliberately stayed away from any reviews or comments on this film. But I couldn't avoid all of the hype and that hype, by its very nature, made me constantly aware I was watching a movie that was going to make huge sums of money. I'm having trouble separating myself from that sense of ""why did they do this?"" And ""why did they choose her."" And, ""Isn't Harrison Ford a stitch."" Not Han Solo but Harrison Ford. Anyway, I have to admit that I sort of enjoyed it. It has lots of action, some interesting characters, a nostalgic feel, and so on. And a force is a force of course, of course. I skipped work so I could be at the first screening of the first ""Star Wars"" film back in 1977. I have to admit that as a reader of much challenging science fiction, I found the whole thing pretty bland. But it is a cultural entity, it bears watching. I don't know that there was much new here that would make one want badly to come back for more. When I saw the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, I marked my calendar, hoping I would live to see all three episodes. And in that one, I already knew the plot. I'll be interested to see how this holds up to the test of time. For me the second set of the films are quite forgettable. And, again, for me, only one of the original caught my interest."

107,tt2488496,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,6.0,"Now the title of this review is probably the ultimate compliment when it comes to huge Star Wars fans out there. Unfortunately I am not one of them. I liked the old films and I liked this new movie here just as much, without considering either to be groundbreaking or some other superlative. This new movie runs for 2 hours and 15 minutes and was written and directed by J.J. Abrams, who is mostly known for ""Lost"" and ""Star Trek"". It is the ultimate breakthrough movie for John Boyega, but even more so Daisy Ridley. And while I liked the latter, I thought that it was so nice to see Oscar Isaac as usual. Cool reunion also from ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" with Adam Driver here, even if the two had no scenes together. Fans of the old ""Star Wars"" film will appreciate the inclusion of Harrison Ford, who has lots of screen time, Carrie Fisher, who has solid screen time, and Mark Hamill, who has almost no screen time, but it is indicated that he will make a much bigger impact in the next film.This new ""Star Wars"" film managed no less than five Academy Award nominations, all in the technical categories and this also describes the film perfectly. Yes there are some interesting plot developments and characters, but it's really all about the technical side. Music, effects, editing etc. are all really good. The acting is mostly fine, but nothing to rave about. This does also include Harrison Ford, who has a truly baity supporting role here and I am a bit shocked he got no awards attention for his turn here. He and Driver also share the most dramatic and emotionally crucial scene of the film during their interaction on a bridge. Oh yeah and let us not forget about the light saber action scenes. These are truly cool to watch, no denying. There are a couple more famous names included here and the one I want to mention as well is Domhnall Gleeson, who is having an amazing year with all the films he is in.Finally, I also liked the little robot and Chewbacca of course, who bring some solid comic relief, certainly more than most of the ""human"" characters' one-liners that weren't as funny as they were intended to be. All in all, this film was pretty much what I expected. Great action and impressive visually (check it out on the big screen), but not really convincing in terms of story and character development. The financial success does not come surprising at all though. The brand is obviously as much in demand as always. I believe it was a good watch and if you like science fiction more than I do, you will probably have an even better watch and appreciate this film even more than I did. This does not say, of course, that I did not like it. On the contrary, I had a pretty good time and it's certainly an achievement for a film with that runtime that I almost never felt it dragged. Thumbs up and nice cliffhanger ending too. I will certainly watch the next one as well."
108,tt2488496,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,6.0,"1977 was a big year in the cinema. Star Wars (later titled Episode IV-A New Hope) came out. It was a big year for me as well. I went to see my first James Bond film in the cinema. Star Wars I saw some years later on television, which as my brother said 20 minutes in. It is just some characters walking in the desert.JJ Abrams who ran out of ideas by the time he went on to direct Star Trek: Into Darkness has not waited long to reuse old ideas for Star Wars 7. Just as Creed carries on the Rocky saga by going back to Rocky 1 & 2, Abrams with Lawrence Kasdan & Michael Arndt has gone back to A New Hope to set up this new trilogy.We are back to the world of Star Wars and with advances in technology, special effects, CGI and animatronics we have not advanced much in visuals from the original trilogy which is over 30 years old from The Return of the Jedi. The visuals are uninspired and rather lazy.We have a Tattooine like planet where a young woman, Rey meets a droid carrying important information regarding Luke Skywalker. Rey comes across Finn a storm-trooper who has had a reawakening of his own and met a rebel fighter to escape.Rey seems to be feeling the force and in a series of coincidences or I guess the power of the force escapes her pursuers in a wreck which turns out to be the Millennium Falcon and later comes across Han Solo and Chewbacca.That is not all the Darth Vader like baddie is the grandson of Darth Vader, the son of Han and Princess Leia who has gone over to the dark side but still conflicted with the power of good. Their will be a father and son reunion and you can all guess how this will turn out as the scene is reminiscent of when Obi Wan encountered Darth Vader.It is entertaining, they put on all the right beats with action scenes coming at the right time and some humour, star cameos such as Daniel Craig voicing a storm-trooper or an actress, Harriet Walter who is the niece of Christopher Lee. It is just the story has been recycled and you think that after 30 years, this is the best they could do?If Lucas wanted a new trilogy he might has well remastered and re- edited his original trilogy because I know where this is heading."
109,tt2488496,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,"Thirty years after the fall of the Galactic Empire, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is vanished and there is a new threat to the Republic: The First Order under the command of the Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). General Leia (Carrie Fisher) from the Resistance has sent her best pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) to the planet Jakku to get a map with the location of her brother. However, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and the Stormtroopers destroy the village and Poe hides the map in his droid BB- 8 before he is captured. Ren wants to kill the last Jedi and needs to know his whereabouts. But the Stormtrooper FN-2187 (John Boyega) saves Poe and flees with him in a TIE fighter. Poe calls him Finn, but they crash on Jakku and Finn survives while Poe disappears. Meanwhile the scavenger teenager Rey (Daisy Ridley) finds BB-8 and brings him to the trade camp. But Ren discovered that BB-8 has the map and attacks Jakku. However Rey, Finn and BB-8 steal the Millennium Falcon that is left in a junkyard and escape from Jakku. When the spacecraft breaks down in space, they meet Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca. They have an incident with gangs but they succeed to go to the Resistance base, but Rey is captured by Ren. But the Resistance learns that the huge Starkiller Base is powering a weapon to destroy their planet and now their only chance to destroy the weapon depends on Han Solo, Chewbacca and Finn that wants to save Rey. All the fans had great expectations with ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"", but the film has an unoriginal story. The franchise is orphan of George Lucas and the new writers were not able to create anything new. The Death Star is replaced by the Starkiller Base. Darth Vader, the father of Luke Skywalker, is replaced by Kylo Ren, the son of Han Solo and Leia. R2-D2 is replaced by BB-8. Senator Palpatine, or Darth Sidious, is replaced by the Supreme Leader Snoke. The destruction of the weapon depends of the explosion of the power generator. There are so many similarities in the story of ""The Force Awakens"" with the other episodes that gives the sensation of déjà vu. In addition, the characters are poorly developed. All good things should come to an end, but greed is the root of all evil. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Star Wars: O Despertar da Força"" (""Star Wars: The Awekening of the Force"")"
110,tt2488496,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,,"By all accounts, this film really shouldn't work as well as it does. Looking at it in the cold light of day it is essentially a repeat of the original film in terms of narrative – albeit with some details changed and all the characters moved sideways by a generation. So we have the same parent/child divide, the same innocent discovering their power, right down to the same finale with a large planet-sized weapon. Associated with this it also rides very heavily on nostalgia and brand recognition so that we probably accept a lot of plotting conveniences that we would scoff at in a film we came into cold. However, even seeing all these things, it is hard not to love it for how well it works.It does this by getting the balanced right between all the many aspects that the film seeks to pull together. So we have the nostalgia and a very familiar narrative, but at the same time we have a story that is delivered in a way that engages and is surprisingly moving at times (albeit due to that self-same nostalgia and reliance on us already being invested in this universe and the characters). It also manages to be fun but yet also able to transition into darker moments without one damaging our enjoyment of the other. This is what makes it work I think – because it is really an enjoyable film to watch. It never really stops moving, and the characters are rather thin, but within this frame they work and are engaging.The cast are a big part of that, and it is a very well-cast piece given that the new faces are not dominated by the old familiar ones. Boyega makes good on that charisma he showed when playing the lead in Attach the Block, while Ridley is really natural and likable. For all the fuss over a black storm trooper and a female 'Luke', the truth is that both do a great job regardless of race/color – but do bring that extra factor into play (I had a daughter recently, and it did rather focus my mind on the deficient of strong female characters who are played for themselves, not for their sexuality). The cast is deep in familiar faces and really everyone is on good form – Fisher perhaps seems there because she has to be, but it was nice to see Ford manage to have a bit of a twinkle back in his eyes. The volume of familiar faces in tiny roles does get a bit distracting (particularly if you have watched any shows from Abrams and know his usual cast) but this is a minor thing since the film otherwise does a very good job of keeping you with it for all its adventure and fun.Such a hyped film with such weight on its shoulders really shouldn't be able to be so light on its feet while also delivering dramatic and emotional moments, but it does. A really enjoyable Star Wars film that delivers a lot – and regardless what George Lucas thinks, it has been a very long time since that was the case."
111,tt2488496,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,9.0,"The opening sequence informs us Luke is missing and the ""First Order"" has replaced ""The Empire."" It is lead by another helmet covered Dark Lord whose identity is revealed about 50-60 minutes into the film. By this time the other two major characters are developed.Finn (John Boyega) is a storm trooper who joins the resistance. He becomes a love interest, or so it seems (unless they are somehow brother and sister, they did that twist before) of Rey.Rey (Daisy Ridley) is a tech savvy fighter who on one occasion takes a Katniss pose. Her parentage is not revealed in this film, but she acts similar to another famous character and my guess she is the granddaughter of...Oh c'mon they make it obvious.For those who loved the old Star Wars (and I think that is why we are here) there are plenty of identical lines and similar scenes from the original films, including a cantina, search for a droid, and a Death Star type battle...not to mention that scene of which we do not speak.The role of the Emperor is now the Snoke (Andy Serkis) who looks like a giant Lord Voldemort, perhaps the worse part of the production.The film hits upon the nostalgia elements using the same sound track to create emotional and heart pumping scenes. And yes, we can guess the sequel will look like ""The Empire Strikes Back"" because original writing is scarce and that is what sells tickets.Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity."
112,tt2488496,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,7.0,"Although if you either dismiss Episode 1-3 it could also be ""the fourth Awakens"". But back to this one and let me begin with, that I'm not even close to being in the top of the biggest fans, when it comes to Star Wars. I came late to the party and enjoyed the movies (some more, some less) and am not obsessed with the whole thing. Always liked Han Solo, especially the way Ford portrayed him.Having said that and not being able to be too detailed on every little inside joke, I can tell you that this feels like a Star Wars movie to me. Maybe it's on the surface and maybe some feel it is even too close to the Originals (copying certain things, paying respect as others would describe it). It's just the beginning of a new trilogy and 2016 has another Star Wars movie lined up, that is more of a spin off. So to see what the repercussions are (for surviving characters), you'll have to wait until 2017. As it is and as cliché as some things go down (like our main ""bad guy"" here, so misunderstood as he would possibly say himself) and as predictable as others are, you will have a couple of wow moments and giving the new female lead some power to be doing stuff rather than just being there, this has a lot going for it.Maybe not the best Star Wars movie out there and interestingly enough the reaction was either love or hate (do people really think of this being worse than Episode 1? Wow). Embrace it for what it is, because it does capture what George Lucas was trying to do back in the day ..."
113,tt2488496,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,"I've taken my time getting to this review, having seen the movie twice and allowing nearly three thousand other reviewers take their shot at the picture. I have mixed feelings about ""The Force Awakens"". As a stand alone movie I think it works well enough. It's got the CGI enhanced battle action down pat and the new characters add some fresh blood to the Star Wars universe which most of us expected. This is where I think I'll insert the 'but'.....To quote Han Solo from my summary line above - ""This is not how I thought the day was gonna go."" Another way to say it is - ""Where was the magic""? I think I probably speak for anyone old enough to have been around for the original ""Star Wars"" in 1977. The first time you saw a land cruiser, or a hologram image of Princess Leia, or walked into the Mos Eisley cantina - man, that was magic. The legend of Obi Wan Kenobi had a mystery to it and you couldn't wait for that mystery to reveal itself.With this movie, it doesn't feel like the principals involved were interested in exploring a distant galaxy far, far away, instead directing their energy to the land of here and now. There wasn't so much a story here as the next evolution in computer generated special effects and characters created to appeal to a diverse cross section of movie goers. All well and good, but I think most Star Wars fans would welcome some serious character development and a story arc that anticipates an eventful wind up to the Star Wars saga. I don't expect that we'll get that now.Here's the one thing that did intrigue me out of the whole movie though, and I haven't read anyone else comment on it. When Han Solo follows Kylo Ren out to the bridge of the Star Killer base, he shouts out 'BEN' to which his son responds. See, this is the magic I was talking about earlier. It sounded to me like Kylo Ren was named after Ben Kenobi. If only the rest of the story could have been that cool."
114,tt2488496,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,5.0,"It was inevitable that they were going to milk the franchise long after the story assumed to be done. ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" brings back the characters from episodes 4-6 and adds some new ones. Given the frequent one-liners and self-references, I get the feeling that the aim is to make all the nerds/geeks have fun. I will say that unlike ""The Phantom Menace"", I understood the plot this time; with the former, I didn't understand the plot until I listened to ""Weird Al"" Yankovic's song ""The Saga Begins"" (a parody of ""American Pie"").So, it's no masterpiece. The plot is mainly two hours of light saber fighting and shooting lasers. Basically, if you go in expecting nothing more than stuff that's meant to appeal to the characters on ""The Big Bang Theory"", then you won't be disappointed. If anything important came out of the movie, I'd say that it's Carrie Fisher's shutting down of people who have nothing better to do than comment on her age.That's all that I have to say about this movie."
115,tt2488496,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,10.0,"Disney paid over $4 billion to buy Lucasfilm, George Lucas himself served as creative consultant, I was super excited about a new movie, and the original stars returning, it was just a question of whether the acquisition was worth it, forget the prequels (no Jar Jar Binks), directed by J. J. Abrams (Lost, Mission: Impossible III, Star Trek, Super 8). Basically, it's been 30 years since the destruction of the second Death Star, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), the last Jedi, has disappeared, the remains of the fallen Galactic Empire have risen and become The First Order, seeking to eliminate Skywalker and the Republic, the Resistance, backed by the Republic, are led by Luke's sister, Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), opposing the First Order and searching for Luke. On the planet Jakku, Resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) obtains a map to Luke's location from village elder Lor San Tekka (Max von Sydow), Stormtroopers, commanded by Kylo Ren (What If's Adam Driver), destroy the village and capture Poe, his droid BB-8 escapes with the map, and comes across scavenger Rey (introducing Daisy Ridley) at a junkyard settlement. The First Order Stormtrooper FN-2187 (Attack the Block's John Boyega) is unable to kill, gets away, frees Poe and they escape in a stolen TIE fighter, Poe gives him the new name ""Finn"". Poe and Finn crash on Jakku, Finn appears to be the only survivor, he finds Rey and BB-8 in the village, the First Order find them and attack, the three flee the planet in the stolen, rundown Millennium Falcon. Following a chase and escape, the Falcon breaks down and is captured by a larger ship, piloted by Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew and Joonas Suotamo), they reclaim their former ship, finding Rey and Finn, Han explains that Luke tried to rebuild the Jedi Order, but a student turned to the Dark Side, Luke went into exile and all he built was destroyed. The five escape on the Falcon when attacked by criminal gangs, the gangs inform the First Order of Han's involvement, the Falcon lands on the planet Takodana, the group meet cantina owner Maz Kanata (12 Years a Slave's Lupita Nyong'o), who can help BB-8 reach the Resistance, Rey finds Luke Skywalker's lightsaber, it also belonged to his father Anakin. The First Order have converted a planet into a superweapon capable of destroying star systems, Starkiller Base, Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) orders General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) to use the weapon for the first time to destroy the Republic capital and its fleet, Snoke tells Ren he must kill his father, Han Solo. Takodana is attacked by the First Order, Finn uses the lightsaber in a fight, Resistance X-wing fighters save Finn, Han and Chewbacca, they are led by Poe, but Rey is captured and taken to Starkiller Base, she resists Ren's interrogation and mind-reading, and Rey discovers her powers of the Force, using a Jedi mind trick to escape her cell. Han, Chewbacca, Finn and BB-8 meet Leia at the Resistance base on D'Qar, droid C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) explains that R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) has been inactive since Luke's disappearance, the group learn that BB- 8's map to Luke's location is incomplete. The Resistance plan to lower the planetary shield of Starkiller Base, before it will fire on D'Qar, so the fighters can attack, Leia asks Han to bring their son back alive; Han, Chewbacca and Finn infiltrate the base in the Falcon, the shield is lowered and Rey is found, and explosives are set. They encounter Ren, Han confronts him, using his birth name Ben, and implores him to turn from the Dark Side, but Ren kills his father Han, Chewbacca shoots Ren and sets off the explosives, the Resistance X-wing fighters therefore attack the weapon and the Starkiller Base is destroyed in a chain reaction. Injured Ren chases Finn and Rey to the surface, Finn is injured in a fight using the lightsaber, Rey takes it and overpowers Ren, who is wounded, they are finally separated by the ground crumbling, Snoke orders General Hux to evacuate and bring Ren to him, while Rey, Chewbacca and Finn escape in the Falcon. The Resistance celebrate victory on On D'Qar, but Leia, Chewbacca and Rey mourn Han's death, R2-D2 awakens and reveals the rest of the map, Rey follows this to an island on a distant planet, and there she finds Luke Skywalker, offering him his lightsaber.

Ford, Fisher and Hamill returning makes the nostalgia all the more fun, newcomers Ridley and Boyega are fantastic talents, and Driver a great choice for villain, supporting cast members do great as well. I was hoping the feel of the fantastic originals would be reignited, I'm happy to say it met all my expectations, the story is well written and played out, the chase and fight sequences are highly exciting, and the special effects are amazing, this truly is a return to the good old days and I cannot wait for the next, a brilliant science-fiction fantasy action adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Music, Original Score for John Williams, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing, and Best Visual Effects, and it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Production Design, Best Original Music, and Best Sound.

116,tt2488496,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,10.0,"Thirty years after the destruction of the second Death Star and the overthrow of the Empire a new force has risen from its ashes; the First Order. Luke Skywalker, the last Jedi, has disappeared and both the First Order and rebels, who are now known as The Resistance are searching for him. A map to his location has been found and given to rebel pilot Poe Dameron but the First Order's storm troopers attack before he can get it back to the resistance he gives the map to his droid, BB-8, and tells it to get far away.Dameron is captured buy the sinister Kylo Ren but is helped to escape by defecting storm trooper FN-2187, soon renamed Finn. Their flight doesn't get them far though; they crash and it looks as though Dameron is dead. Meanwhile BB-8 is found by a scavenger named Rey; she shortly meets with Finn and, thinking he is in the resistance they manage to escape in a familiar ship.Their journey to the resistance base will bring them into contact with some familiar characters and into many life of death situations. We also learn why Luke has disappeared and the connection between Kylo Ren and the central trio from the original 'Star Wars' films.Anybody who has seen the original 'Star Wars' film will find the plot of this film very similar; this may be a problem for some viewers but I found myself really enjoying this and think it was probably the best film in the series since 'The Empire Strikes Back' it is helped by the lack of things like Ewoks and Jar Jar Binks! The new characters were pretty impressive, in particular Rey and Finn. Their characters developed nicely through the film; this was particularly true of Rey as she starts to discover her strength in using The Force; thankfully the writers didn't rush to explain why she was so strong; no doubt we'll learn in later films. It was great to see many original characters even though Luke's appearance can best be described as a cameo or even a teaser as to what is to come in episode eight. While the overall story doesn't feature any major twists there is one very surprising moment for those who have managed to avoid spoilers. The cast does a solid job; newcomers Daisy Ridley and John Boyega were great as Rey and Finn and of the original cast members Harrison Ford stands out as he has the most prominent role. The film features plenty of exciting action as some humorous moments which thankfully don't feel too forced. Overall I really enjoyed this film and heartily recommend it to fans of the original films."
117,tt2488496,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,"I have just come back home from the cinema after having spent the evening there with my family watching the new ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"". And I am thrilled, excited and ecstatic.There was a big hype about ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"", and you would have to be living in a cave somewhere if that had eluded you. And no wonder that there was so much hype about it, because director J.J. Abrams did have some rather big shoes to fill out after taking over from legendary George Lucas. And then just how did he manage to do? In my honest opinion, then J.J. Abrams did an amazing job, hand on heart.And having grown up with ""Star Wars"" and loving the franchise, then I was also anticipating the movie and looking forward to seeing what J.J. Abrams would bring to the table. And I think that after the last three movies - parts one, two and three - in the legacy, then it could be nothing but better. And yes, J.J. Abrams succeeded and picked up the torch nicely and continuing in the spirit of the original trilogy - parts four, five and six.Story-wise, then J.J. Abrams was working on the continuation of the last movie ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"", and this seventh movie was set 30 years after the defeat of the Empire and the destruction of the second Death Star; being the end of the ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"" movie. And while ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" boasts a completely new array of characters, then the return of the core essential characters from the original trilogy (parts four, five and six) return to part seven as well.So just how did these new characters fit into the legacy and the story that J.J. Abrams told in ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens""? Personally, I must admit that I think that the character gallery was amazing, and the talents cast to play the roles were really nicely chosen and were doing really good jobs in bringing the characters to life on the screen. Of course Luke Skywalker (played by Mark Hamill), Han Solo (played by Harrison Ford), Leia Organa (played by Carrie Fisher), C3P0 (played by Anthony Daniels), R2D2 (played by Kenny Baker) and Chewbacca (played by Peter Mayhew) need no introduction. But the new characters introduced in ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" did prove really good and had lots of variety. Rey (played by Daisy Ridley), Finn (played by John Boyega), Poe Dameron (played by Oscar Isaac) and Kylo Ren (played by Adam Driver) did prove to be good characters that will be memorable as those in the original trilogy. However, and yes there is a however, I didn't really think that the villainous Kylo Ren was all that impressive, just seemed like a cheap knock off of Darth Vader, to be honest.And while we are on the topic of the new characters, then I am excited to see the next movies and follow the stories of these newly established characters. But also to follow the continued story of the heroes from the original trilogy.The storyline told in ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" was good, and I had all my hopes and wishes fulfilled by J.J. Abrams's storytelling, and he really did a good job in continuing the timeless space saga. However, there was just too many parallels to the first movies. I mean, a galactic power force that has built a massive weapon capable of destroying planets, and a small force of opposition attempting to foil their plans. It had been done twice already, so on that account, Abrams did leave us hardcore fans with a somewhat dry sensation in our mouths. But the story told around the core characters was good, thrilling and fast-paced. And I think that he managed to incorporate a good many things and details for each individual character and tie them together nicely for a greater picture.And having the special effects team return to physical effects and not rely on CGI as they did in parts one, two and three was a good thing, because they returned to how they worked their magic in parts four, five and six. And the special effects guys really went back to the roots with lots of details, fabulous creatures, great costumes and captured that unique ""Star Wars"" sensation. And boy was that magic back with a vengeance. I was completely blown away with all the details and touches added to this movie. And the space dogfights was just exciting like you wouldn't believe. It was like you were there yourself.Yes, I am a fan of ""Star Wars"", that is no secret and no doubt about it, and it warms my heart to have this glorious return to the original trilogy, and to see it leave the work of George Lucas in parts one, two and three far, far behind in its wake.""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is exactly what was needed to put new life into the franchise, especially after the massacre the franchise was exposed to with parts one, two and three. And on that account, then J.J. Abrams deserves a massive applause for this accomplishment with this movie. I respectfully salute thee.If you enjoy the ""Star Wars"" saga, then you should embrace ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" with open arms, because it really is a majestic return to the atmosphere and sensation of the original trilogy."
118,tt2488496,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,6.0,"A fairly long time ago, in a county not so far away (Elstree Studios are an hour's drive away from yours truly), a great adventure took place. Now, J.J. Abrams, in league with the 'House of Mouse', has returned to make a seventh chapter in the franchise, and it's almost identical in plot to the first film, but with only a fraction of the magic and charm.Daisy Ridley plays Luke sorry, I mean Rey a scavenger on the desert planet of Tatooine sorry, I mean Jakku who becomes involved in the rebellion against The Empire sorry I mean The First Order after she bumps into R2D2 sorry, I mean BB-8 , a droid carrying plans to the death star sorry, I mean to the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker. Meanwhile, the First Order are preparing their new weapon, the Death Star sorry, I mean Starkiller Base for use against the rebellion, who are forced to launch a risky counter-attack that sees Rey coming face-to-face with masked villain Darth Vader sorry, I mean Kylo Ren (Adam Driver).I've learnt to keep my expectations low for Star Wars films since The Phantom Menace, so I can't say The Force Awakens was a massive disappointment; it is what I feared it would be—a rather safe reboot, lacking in fresh ideas, which aims to please younger viewers with flashy visuals, whilst pandering to the older generation by including sly nods to the original trilogy. Personally, I would much rather they had taken a bolder approach: let's be honest they couldn't have got it any more wrong than the prequels.There's a spark of originality in the form of Finn (John Boyega), a stormtrooper who has a change of heart and joins the rebellion, the production design and effects are incredible, and I admit that the return of Han Solo and Chewbacca warmed even my cynical heart, but on the whole I was left wanting by this latest instalment, particularly the final assault on the Starkiller Base, which was completely bereft of tension. In fact, my favourite moment of the whole film is when Carrie Fisher tries to convey anguish, but her plastic surgery doesn't let her."
119,tt2488496,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,,"My wife and I enjoyed this at home on DVD from our local public library. JJ Abrams did a good job directing this movie mostly in the style of the original Star Wars movies beginning in 1977. I've been around long enough to remember them well and the positive stir they created. I had a good friend who became a giant fan of the robot C3PO, who also makes an appearance here, 38 years after the original.Most of the running time and action involve a set of new, mostly younger actors. The bad guys want to control the galaxy (far, far away) and part of their plan is to find and eliminate Luke Skywalker, believed to be hidden away in a remote location. A map, stored on a solid state device, is the key.For me the most fun was their bringing back the main actors (and their characters) from the originals. Harrison Ford, who was in his 30s when all this started, is now in his 70s as Han Solo. His old ship, the Millennium Falcon relegated to a junkyard, serves a key role in the battles and as an escape vehicle. Mark Hamill is back as Luke Skywalker, Carrie Fisher is back as Princess Leia who has become a general, and Peter Mayhew, all 7 feet and 3 inches of him, is back as Chewbacca.Good movie and very entertaining, we enjoyed it.SPOILERS: Solo and Leia have a son, who has inherited some of his grandfather's (Darth Vader) powers is also leading the effort of the bad guys. There is a confrontation between him and Solo, where dad is trying to talk him into abandoning the dark side, but the son puts his lightsaber through Han who apparently then falls to his death."
120,tt2488496,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,"Somehow, even with all the hatred, Star Wars: The Force Awakens managed to bring in 2 billion. Obviously the box office is no indication of whether or not a movie is good. The appeal was the reuniting of the original cast - Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Luke Hamill, along with Chewie and 3CPO, and to introduce some new characters to carry on in the next films.I have to admit, it looked like a big video game to me. What I enjoyed the most was Ford, particularly his repartee with Chewy. For me, it was great to see Fisher and Hamill again.These films that take place in space are yesterday's westerns and war movies. It used to be the science fiction films, the Buck Rogers, Superman, Dick Tracy etc., were B movies. Once the computer and CGI came in, they quickly became A films, perfect for the big screen. Someone once told me that most movies are made for 15-year-old boys in Thailand. It makes sense - I mean, what was there to grasp about this film that a 15-year-old non-English speaking person couldn't grasp? I haven't followed this franchise much since the first three films, though I did see the Anakin Skywalker-Natalie Portman movie. I think it's fairly obvious that this film brings us back to the original Star Wars. Harrison Ford was paid $10,000 for the first Star Wars. His salary is higher now and he has a percentage of the box office. He's old, he looks old, but you can't beat him. He's an old-fashioned movie star in an old-fashioned movie. I didn't feel that Carrie Fisher had enough to do though I enjoyed her.So why give this an 8? Why? It was fun, it was entertaining, I loved the original stars. The new people -- Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Oscar Isaac are all attractive and are very good. Will I go and see the next Star Wars? Probably, because Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher are in it and somehow, so is Harrison Ford. That to me is Star Wars."
121,tt2488496,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,7.0,"So the good news to report first is that J.J. Abrams is someone who loves Star Wars enough that he more than respects the mythology, which itself is cobbled together from past mythological stories, both old (back to the Greeks with the Gods) and modern (serials and comics), but also recognizes that in this 'Episode' series as a saga a lot of it has to come back to family. The Force Awakens works tremendously when it focuses on the two (maybe three) new characters who are introduced in this series, and the familiar is both welcome and sometimes questionable, but mostly welcome all the same. It's a movie made for the fans, but it's not necessarily a ""fan-film"", if that makes sense. It's the logical progression of this franchise in 2015 and by a filmmaker like Abrams it's a commendable effort (if not great, read on for more, and of course SPOILERS be ahead).First of all, the first act of this movie is magnificent. New heroes are introduced, one of which, a deflecting Stormtrooper for the newly formed First Order named Finn (though it's technically not his real name, and oddly enough his given name is an in-joke for ANH fans), is remarkable. I loved this character as someone who did seem like a new presence - not someone who is a space pirate or destined for something greater, just a guy who was raised to do just one thing and has a conscience and decides to act on it. As played by John Boyega he's the best part of the movie overall for me (yes, even with mother-f***ing Han Solo and the new cute droid BB8 included), and he gives Finn passion and fire and occasional humor but is a fully formed character; he's fulfilling the promise seen in him in Attack the Block, and I can't wait to see more of his character in the next episodes.Likewise Daisy Ridley, a new actress relatively, is very good as Rey - though she at first is another character (or I should say archetype) that's familiar via Joseph Campbell as the Hero Destined for a Journey, Ridley gives her spunk and equal fire to Boyega, and it's a joy to see how they meet and join forces in the first act. Everything about this opening is so strong, a lot of it told without dialog (and when it does come in it feels simple but just right somehow) that it's a shame that the rest of the film doesn't quite live up. And it's not that the quality jumps off a cliff, but, for me, this first act of shaping this new world, the new evils (Adam Driver as the new sort of ""Darth"" Kylo Ren), hits its high point once Han Solo (Harrison Ford, acting like he'd never left the role, he's just there) and Chewbacca come in to the picture.In a way the 'spine' of the movie, in other words the events that lead everyone from point A to B to C, are really close to that of A New Hope. At the same time, I got the feeling like Abrams, probably knowing this would be his only shot at making a Star Wars movie (whether he wants to do one again is his call, but I believe he's declined), has put EVERYTHING he'd want to do in a SW movie in one film. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and Abrams passion for thios world comes through in almost every frame. But it almost feels a little cramped by the time the last act comes around and as our heroes face off against Kylo Ren (following the death of a pretty damn prominent character, sort of in keeping with the family-tragedy line of the series, I can't even bring myself to say it), there's the ""Starkiller"" Base, which is basically the Death Star on steroids.It's a much darker film than I expected. Matter of fact, the third act has the sort of pacing issues to the point I almost forgot about the Starkiller Base plan, and it had not really much urgency considering its level of threat. It's also a little unclear just how FAST a particular character gets Jedi-Force powers (the explanation of Rey having them is fine, but it seems like just how quickly is too much, as if she would need more, say, training to do ALL that she does, and comes off more like a story contrivance). And by the time it gets to this section of the film, where emotions are really high but callbacks are still done - even to things like, say, a trash compactor, or an Admiral Ackbar appearance - it's a bit much.The number of gripes that I can ponder over are many... and yet I still recommend the film highly. For all the little faults in the storytelling or little bits of deus ex machina (at one point involving a split in the ground that separates two characters in a dual at just the right moment), this is a full-bloodied, extremely well directed, shot with fire in the cinematographer's cortex (and a lack of unnecessary lens flares!) Star Wars movie. In the ways that ultimately count, in the spine as I mentioned, its familiarity is in keeping with how this saga has been unfolding over six films, with familial bonds and the mystical element of the Force guiding things in directions of good and/vs evil. It does what the 2009 Star Trek film, also from Abrams, did so well: reintroduce us to this universe with energy and spunk, give fans and newcomers what they want, and allow some new actors to act their buts off while giving veterans a chance to shine.Oh, and BB8 is cute as a button. If only R2 had more screen time for them as a buddy-droid team..."
122,tt2488496,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,"As someone who grew up watching the original trilogy (that's the ones from '77-'83 that starred Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher), I was a little stoked to watch this one with those three returning. Ford appears the most in this and he makes the most of his presence. The funniest lines are from him and it's such a joy when he's on screen. Ms. Fisher doesn't seem as charismatic as in her previous stints as Leia but she's still pretty good at what she's required being now an older version of her. She and Ford have some nice scenes together. Hamill doesn't appear much so we'll have to wait for the next one in the series to see how he fares though I did like his beard at the end. The new players, mainly Finn and Rey, are good enough as characters. J.J. Abrams does a good enough job taking over for George Lucas. This was quite exciting for me and my movie theatre-working friend. So on that note, I recommend Star Wars: The Force Awakens."
123,tt2488496,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,9.0,"One can only have deep respect and admiration for a genius individual like J.J. Abrams I think one of the most difficult things to accomplish in the film industry is to revive a legendary and immeasurably popular franchise, but Abrams achieved in doing so not just once – with ""Star Trek"" – but now twice, with the even more astounding new ""Star Wars"" installment. ""Star Trek"" and ""Star Wars"" aren't just your average type of successful Sci-Fi movies, no, they became so humongous that they became immortal cult phenomena with millions of obsessive fans, countless of spin-offs and imitations and merchandising business that started to lead a life of their own. In order to appeal to this many skeptical and demanding fans, your film just has to be really, REALLY good! ""Episode VII: The Force Awakens"" is a fantastic film, and even though I'm not an avid ""Star Wars"" admirer, it was the first one since ""The Empire Strikes Back"" that truly impressed and overwhelmed me. Episodes I, II and III, that were released between 1999 and 2005 and directed by George Lucas himself, were not exactly worshiped by the die-hard SW-fans. Arguably that's because Mr. Lucas wrote and directed the prequels from a creator's point of view and not enough from a fan-boy's perspective. Abrams clearly is a big fan of the saga and probably knows more about Lucas' creation than he does himself, and that makes him the ideal person to helm the next generation of Star Wars cinema. ""The Force Awakens"" has a solid and absorbing scenario, breathtaking decors and set-pieces, spectacular action scenes (brought to an even higher level of awesomeness thanks to the exquisite 3D) and – perhaps the most important of all – a truly excellent and versatile cast of characters. First and foremost there's the return of some legendary heroes, of course, like Han Solo and Chewbacca, but also the newly introduced protagonists are fascinating characters. Personally, I've always been most attracted to the Dark Side, so I adored the new and powerful foe Kylo Ren (and particularly his private mental battle), the relentless army General Hux and the rather disturbing Supreme Leader Snoke. But also the good guys are extremely likable, like tough girl Rey and the reshaped Stormtrooper Finn. I can't wait for episodes 8 and 9!"
124,tt2488496,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,7.0,"Despite the huge love there is out there for 'Star Wars' after the lukewarm response the prequels gained rebooting the saga was always a risk. Especially when there was so much hype about how 'great' this film was bound to be.And to be fair it is a good film and in my opinion one of the best in the saga. It has a lot of action, a logical and clear plot and all the new actors fit in with the stars from the originals such as Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher.Of the old crew it is Ford who has the lion share of the screen time and yet again oozes charisma as Han Solo. His interactions with Daisy Ridley (who herself shines) is great and mirrors the Obi Wan/Luke set up of 'A New Hope'.Yes, there are flaws and the plot does feel a little like a remix of what's gone before, but Abrams has achieved his goal of bringing 'Star Wars' back to the head of the sci fi table."
125,tt2527336,Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,8.0,"I think the easiest way to sum up this movie is to call it ""The Empire Strikes Back II"". In many, many ways, it's a bridge movie between the last film and the next and, if you think about it, nothing is really resolved in the film. Now this is NOT saying it's a bad film. Heck, it's exactly what most fans probably want--tons of action, lots of heroism and a lot of the familiar. The plot is basically this. The Rebels* are about to be wiped out and the film consists of the new Empire (which looks pretty much like the old Empire) is intent on wiping them out. In the meantime, Rey goes of on a desperate mission to try to get Luke Skywalker to STOP sulking (which, apparently he's been doing for the last 40 years) and help! Along for the fun are some nice newer characters and one who seemed a bit annoying (and that would be you,Poe...Mr. Know-it-all). Overall, it's a lot of fun, there are a lot of explosions and it has a lot to offer unless you stop and realize it is, essentially, a bridge movie. A well made bridge movie but still a bridge film.*Yes, I know the Rebels won a few films back."
126,tt2527336,Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.0,"Loved the original 'Star Wars' films as a kid, still do. Especially 'Empire Strikes Back' while considering 'A New Hope' a genre landmark. Didn't think the prequel films were that bad personally, but they had a lot wrong with them and were a long way from great, especially 'Attack of the Clones'.Found myself loving 'The Force Awakens', which to me was the best 'Star Wars' film since 'The Return of the Jedi' and more an affectionate homage and universe celebration than the re-hash some have criticised it for. Seeing 'The Last Jedi' with quite high expectations, judging from the positive critical word of mouth, and despite enjoying it and finding a lot to like, the fans' disappointment is understandable (though some of the hate has not only been disrespectful but vitriolic). 'The Last Jedi' is not as good as the original trilogy, not even close, or as 'The Force Awakens', but it is better to me than the prequels.As said, the disappointment is understandable and some of the problems fans had with it are also shared by me. 'The Last Jedi' would have been an even better film with less new characters (with variable effectiveness) and less subplots because while it was never dull it did feel at times too busy and bloated. This would have been solved with not having the rushed and pretty unnecessary romantic subplot, which seemed more an excuse to introduce a new character and give an older character more depth, and doing much more with the villains. With the exception of Ren, the film's most interesting character along with Rey, all are underwritten, especially the missed opportunity that was Snoke. He looks good and Andy Serkis portrays him beautifully but he is criminally underused and even more wronged by a far too easy and anti-climactic defeat. Can also understand the outrage at the rather one-dimensional and out of character, even with the self-doubt, torment and regret, treatment of Luke. Despite Mark Hamill objecting to this treatment, it does not show in his nuanced performance that ranks among his best recent work. As well as some of the humour, some of it was forced and out of place in being placed randomly at less than appropriate times. However, for all those faults, there is also a lot to like about 'The Last Jedi'. It does have enough to satisfy the nostalgic while, like 'The Force Awakens', having its own identity. While it certainly dazzles in spectacle and action, 'The Last Jedi' doesn't feel too big, too noisy or too chaotic (fans will disagree with this and that's fine) at the expense of brains or heart. Of the characters, Rey and Ren are especially well realised and it is their subplot that is particularly successful of the storytelling.For all its unevenness and reservations about it trying to do too much, that it is a richer and more elaborate experience, with a deeper and darker perspective on space fantasy allegory and the condition of humans and aliens, than the previous 'Star Wars' films was appreciated.Visually, 'The Last Jedi' is a triumph. It is gorgeously shot and designed and benefits with some very imaginative and energetic visual storytelling. The special effects are a dazzling marvel. John Williams delivers yet another rousing score that has its own character but cleverly includes the well-known iconic themes from the previous films. Enough of the dialogue is thought-provoking and entertaining, while Rey's journey, Ren's conflict, the scenes between Rey and Luke and the Rey and Ren subplot are handled very well. The action is thrilling, particularly the knockout final showdown. When it comes to the acting, despite not liking their characters' treatment there is no fault to be found with Hamill and Serkis as aforementioned. Daisy Ridley gives another winning performance and is more comfortable this time round. John Boyega is charismatic and Carrie Fisher's final performance has a nostalgic poignancy. With Ren being even more of a conflicted villain than in 'The Force Awakens', Adam Driver brings more menace and conflicted edge.In summary, good but not amazing. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
127,tt2527336,Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,8.0,"The Republic has fallen and The First Order under Snoke (Andy Serkis) is taking over. The Resistance led by Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) is on the run once more. Rey (Daisy Ridley) seeks guidance from Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is conflicted about his dark side. Finn (John Boyega), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), and new character Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) try a last ditch effort to save the Resistance.I am left with a lot of nitpicks that don't add up to much and one big observation. This could be the most dangerous Star Wars. First, let's start with some of the nitpicks. There is a lot of humor in this movie. I appreciate it sometimes but there are some serious issues being pushed in this movie and the humor at times clashes. There is some melodrama and sometimes the scenes push too hard. For example, Rose's amulet gets a lot of screen time. It's interesting what happens with Benicio del Toro but sometimes the movie does not need to linger on that pendent. The little kids forced to work the stables can be too much. I'm sure Rian Johnson got the idea from kids being forced to ride racing camels. It would be helpful to have more than just kids in indentured servitude. It becomes too obvious in a bad way. The kamikaze run is cool but the question becomes why they didn't do that with the other ships or in the other movies. The casino idea of the 1% weapon dealers is intriguing but there is too much broad Vegas motif. The Porgs are the Porgs and I'm resigned to the Christmas gifting motive. I either understand or reluctantly accept each one and more of these little annoyances.The overarching observation I have is a lot more uncertain. Rian Johnson is playing with the Star Wars sensibilities and its ultimate outcome is very much in doubt. It makes this a most dangerous Star Wars movie. The central idea of good versus evil is under attack. Benicio del Toro plays a criminal who talks a bit of truth to the audience. He essentially equates both sides. As long as there is war, the weapons dealers win and the people lose. Ghost Yoda literally burns down the Jedi religion. Skywalker's one moment of failure is also a direct shot at his character. Johnson is given new emperor Snoke and he promptly kills him off. Rei's parentage is given as nobodies. The question becomes whether that is the truth. I get the sense that Johnson intends it to be the truth and thereby cutting that branch away from the desperate needs of a Skywalker saga. Time and time again, he is pushing the Star Wars franchise in an intriguing and possibly dangerous direction. Stay tune to see whether it falls apart or succeeds as a new direction that The Force Awakens was never meant to be."
128,tt2527336,Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,,"...and more than intentions. for a part of critics and public - remarkable to the best. for me - an ambitious experiment. with all the virtues and the errors of an experiment who has as essence to discover and explore all the sides of a story well known. bicks near old bricks, explanations, heroism and solitude, refuges and impressive fights, the past in clash against present. all as result of noble and good intentions. but I amitt, the basic question remains the meaning of other trilogy. out of financial interest. all what must be said was said. so, ""The Last Jedi"". and its mix of stories."
129,tt2527336,Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,6.0,"""Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi"" is as the title already states the 8th installment for the long-running Star Wars franchise and the second of 3 films from recently. Rian Johnson took over as director and writer all on his own for this 2.5-hour film and I think he did a really good job. No surprise this won box office for 2017 movies as it was as big of a financial success as it was a success with critics and reviewers like myself, probably even more. I liked episode 7 already, but I loved episode 8 occasionally. Adding Mark Hamill to the cast does so so much for it and it's a shame he won't be back for the final chapter. But this also shows how they are not scared of killing off major characters, legendary characters even, the way they did with Han Solo in the previous. The scenes with Daisy Ridley and her male partners were the absolute highlight. First all the action on the island with Hamill and then the scenes with Adam Driver exploring the complicated relationship between their two characters. I still am not sold at all when it comes to Boyega I must say as the male lead to such a strong franchise. He was clearly overshadowed by the other guys I just mentioned. But he was also hurt by the story with the Asian girl going from zero to hero in the most unrealistic unlikely hero story I have seen in quite some time. The only purpose her character eventually has is making clear there won't be a love story between the two protagonists, just like there wasn't in the old Star Wars films, even if for completely different reasons. Several other actors reprised their roles, most of all Carrie Fisher of course and her untimely death makes some situations fairly awkward as there is a great deal of references on death surrounding her character, even if she lives eventually. As for the other actors: Isaac is a much better actor than he is allowed to show here, Serkis makes for a good bad guy once more, Nyong'o is almost non-existent, Gleeson impressed me once more. Dern and Del Toro bring characters to life that teach you that the first impression isn't always right. As for BDT, I think it was a bit strange how they can't get the real guy and just take him instead, even if he may be gifted. Next best thing huh? Did not feel too smart to be honest.From the technical perspective, this is a huge success too no denying. Visual effects, sound effects, music etc. are all top-notch and other visual stuff like make-up, costumes, sets etc are impressive too. No doubt this film will get a great deal of awards recognition probably up to some Oscar nominations too and maybe one win. The new Star Wars films profit a lot from the generally-assumed mediocrity of episodes 1-3 and this takes a great deal of pressure away from them too, but honestly what we are getting here is fairly impressive. Episode 7 was good already, but this one here has glimpses of excellence and it may be my favorite Star Wars film of them all even. Shame some weaknesses prohibit me from giving this one a ****/*****. But I wanted to at times. I sure am curious about the next one and looking at how disappointed I was by the Star Wars story from last year, this was a delightful watch. No need to avoid superlatives here as these 2.5 hours really never dragged one bit and hardly could have been executed any better. And this comes from somebody who generally includes SciFi among his least favorite genres. Speaking about the non-human characters, all the familiar ones are included too and I liked the charming friendship between Chewbacca and a bunch of space owls. Very cute, look at their faces when he wants to eat that poultry. Heartbreaking stuff there. I also really liked how they worked on the comic relief moments. They were almost always funny, but they did not feel the need to shove them in our faces constantly like a certain other really successful Galaxy-themed franchise is doing these days. Here they go for quality over quantity and it sure pays off. So looking at the cast, this is a must-see thanks to the story and performances from Ridley, Driver and Hamill most of all. I very much recommend checking it out. This is one of the 2017 films you really don't want to miss out on. And it is a worthy addition to the series and will turn Star Wars into an even bigger cultural phenomenon than it already is. Very much recommended, close to a must-see on the big screen."
130,tt2527336,Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,5.0,"In terms of visuals, The Last Jedi is the best looking Star Wars film, shiny bright, wonderful use of monochrome and then adding splashes of red in the climactic battle.It is also overlong, flabby, takes an age to get going and at times feels dull. Just as The Force Awakens made you feel that it was a loose remake of Star Wars: A New Hope. At times you feel an air of The Empire Strikes Back here especially when you see the Imperial Walkers in the desert and the rebels being on the run.The Last Jedi has three subplots. Rey (Daisy Ridley) who has the element of the Force about her meeting Jedi master Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) who has become embittered and reluctant to help the rebels or Rey although he senses the Force is strong in her. Rey of course wants to find out more about her parents but she is also psychically linked to Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) who himself struggling with his own identity on the dark side. Then there are the resistance ships being hunted by the First Order. With General Leia (Carrie Fisher) sidelined, there is tension between impetus hot shot pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) as to how to evade the First Order firepower when you are running on fumes.Finn (John Boyega) the ex-stormtrooper teams up with a clever mechanic Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) to go aboard the enemy ship after first finding a master code breaker to disable their tracking system. Finn might be impressed by the high class casino full of wealthy arms dealers when searching for the master code breaker but Rose schools him on the inequalities of life.The film needed to be sharper, it needed a story that was zippy. What we got is a film that tried to be thoughtful but instead became portentous."
131,tt2527336,Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,5.0,"Poor fate of the magnificent ""Star Wars"" saga. From the moment George Lucas filled his pockets with lots of money, the wonderful saga has become a terrible commercial franchise with exploitation of the worshiped characters to make money. Of course the movie is entertaining, but with nothing new for fans. Shame on you Disney and his new characters. My vote is five.Title (Brazil):""Star Wars: Os Últimos Jedi"" (""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"")"
132,tt2527336,Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,,"I'd heard lots of good things about this film before coming to it; in particular with its darker tone being comparable to Empire Strikes Back. Perhaps this slightly hyped expectation is what led to the film being quite the disappointment. There is an attempt at darker material here, while also shadowing what has gone before, but mostly it feels like a production line film, rather than something made with real energy and risk. That feeling is not anti-Disney for the sake of it (I get most of my entertainment from massive corporations seeking to make money) but certainly part of that is the weight and ease of the franchise, and how it impacts the film.Picking up after the previous film, we find the rebellion on the run while a new Jedi seeks out an old master - so essentially Empire. Within this there is a lot of action and impressive special effects, but surprisingly little in the way of emotional impact - even the previous film has it outstripped on that front. I found the characters pretty bland in the most part, and was surprised by the use of the main characters to essentially do stupid things and waste everyone's time. The moments of conflict have some strengths but there isn't as much human drama there as one would have liked. The action sequences are good in terms of bang for buck, but they don't draw you into them as much as I would have liked.The cast are mixed. Driver remains good and deserves more. Ridley is pretty non-descript here, although the script gives her so little. Boyega doesn't quite have the spark he usually has, and his chemistry with Tran's Rose is pretty non-existent. Hamill is good and has the most to do. The other characters tend not to make much of an impact; majorly significant characters are forgotten or moved aside, and generally he plot goes where it wants to go. In this way the narrative is fine in the grand sweep, but in any specific detail or action it tends not to make sense or to be lazy in the writing.Last Jedi gives you lots of spectacle for your money, and there is enough to it to be entertaining for a few hours; however it is surprisingly sterile. It lacks emotional punch or weight, and plays out even its darker moments in a way that feels designed by committee and lacking rough edges or any sort."
133,tt2527336,Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,6.0,"This is ""Episode VIII"" and the ninth film of the Star Wars trilogy. Not to give too much away, the rebels battle against the Evil Empire as Rey goes to Luke to become a Jedi and give us a fan fiction back story. ""Page turners they were not.""If you are like me, you have seen the other features and knew what was going to happen in nearly every scene, because they did it before. The writing was far from unique and only special effects carried the feature. The young Vader is still a weenie as compared to Darth Vader. Rey, who has been in two films is one of the worst developed major characters. In this film we discover there was nothing spectacular about her parents. Her relationship to Obi Wan is again hinted at, but it is not confirmed. Most likely saving that for the next feature...yes it ended unfinished because snow bunnies can't fight like Ewoks. We learn that The Force operates under yin-yang principles with the possibility of Vader going good or Rey going bad...which BTW the later would make for a better film and kill the predictability. Normally films written this poorly have a shower scene. There is a ""trigger happy fly boy"" and is not played by Tom Cruise. He is our Harrison Ford substitution, and is no Harrison Ford either. The writing for these new episodes is substandard. This is apparently a filler type film (like episode five or worse, 2) which is designed to get us to a climax film that will keep us on the edge of our seats....but don't hold your breath."
134,tt2527336,Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,6.0,"But some only cared about the new ""species"" that got introduced here. But worry not, they are not the new Ewoks. No the Porgs may be displayed a lot in this movie, but they still are just there to have a new toy to seel. If you think this is cynical, you are very gullible. You think anything being made for a big budget movie is not being slated for mass production? Of course kids need toys, so you could try to see it as a win/win.But back to the story that goes on from Episode 7. Recurring characters, and different chapters were everyone involved has something to do. I guess you could compare it to a fellowship but without a ring that has to be retrieved. They still have a goal, whether it's the good guys or the bad guys. It is what it is though and it never was about characters being depicted much - it's about the action, it's about the fantasy, it's about the road to self discovery ... and ultimately good versus evil"
135,tt2527336,Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.0,"It's easy enough to feel conflicted about this film. Upon initial release I was somewhat disappointed with the treatment of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and the unexplained mental 'force' between Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Rey (Daisy Ridley). Well, not that it was entirely unexplained, because Snope claimed he was responsible. I feel a little better following a second viewing of the film, as captioning helped overcome some difficulty with the dialog in the theater. But near the end of the picture there's a scene in which Ren is trying to turn Rey to the dark side, and he says ""Let the past die. Kill it if you have to."" It's as if that was Disney's and director Rian Johnson's message to Star Wars fans who have been with the franchise from the beginning. The treatment of Luke Skywalker still bothers me somewhat, as he seemed awfully out of character compared to the young hero of ""A New Hope"". I get it that he had feelings of failure over the Kylo Ren situation, but he should have seen it from Rey's point of view right from the outset. I'm seriously hoping that the final picture in the series restores some of the original legacy, and that the film makers take stock of spirit Yoda's well offered admonition - ""The greatest teacher, failure is."""

Probably the most important thing about it is that this is the last that we'll ever see of Carrie Fisher on the silver screen.As for the characters, they are what they are. BB-8 is just silly. I will say that I found Rose Tico and DJ interesting. I mainly went to see the movie so that I can say that I've seen all the Star Wars movies. I assumed that this would be a letdown after ""Rogue One"" and I was right. Without a doubt it's nothing special, but entertaining enough."
137,tt2527336,Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,10.0,"The Force Awakens was a brilliant comeback for the successful space franchise, peaking as the third highest-grossing movie in the world, and good for Disney who paid millions to acquire it; naturally hopes were high that the second instalment in the return series would be as good, directed by Rian Johnson (Brick, Looper, Knives Out). Basically, following the battle of Starkiller Base, General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher, in her last film) is leading the Resistance forces in evacuating their base when the First Order fleet arrives. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) goes against orders and leads a costly counterattack that destroys a First Order dreadnought. The remaining Resistance escapes into hyperspace, but the First Order uses a device to track them, and attacks again. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) cannot bring himself to fire at the lead Resistance ship after sensing his mother Leia is on board, but his wingmen destroy the bridge, killing most of the Resistance's leaders. Leia is dragged into space but survives by using the Force. While Leia recovers, Vice-Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) takes over command of the Resistance. Running low on fuel, the remaining fleet is pursued by the First Order. Meanwhile, former storm trooper Finn (John Boyega) wakes up from his coma, and he asks for Rey (Daisy Ridley). Rey has just arrived on the planet Ahch-To with Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and R2-D2 (Jimmy Vee) on the Millenium Falcon to find Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Luke doesn't want to see her or know who she is and why she has sought him out. After initially saying that the Jedi should end, he hears what happened to Han Solo, and is encouraged by R2-D2. Luke has a change of heart and agrees to give Rey three lessons in the ways of the Force. Rey and Kylo begin communicating through the Force, which puzzles them both. Kylo tells Rey that Luke feared his power. Luke confesses that he thought about killing Kylo, sensing that Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) was corrupting him. This prompted Kylo to destroy Luke's new Jedi Order, and caused him to disappear and self-exile himself. Convinced that Kylo can be redeemed, Rey leaves Ahch-To. Luke prepares to burn the Jedi library but hesitates when the spirit of master Yoda (Frank Oz) appears. Yoda uses the Force to summon a bolt of lightning to destroy the library and encourages Luke to learn from his failure. Meanwhile, Poe entrusts Finn, mechanic Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), and BB-8 with a secret mission to disable the First Order's tracking device. Maz Kanata (Lupita Nyong'o) directs them to the casino town of Canto Bight, where they meet the hacker DJ (Benicio Del Toro). The local security pursues them, but they escape Canto Bight with the help of stable hand children and racing animals they set free. Finn, Rose, and DJ infiltrate Snoke's flagship but are captured by Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie). Kylo brings Rey to Snoke, who reveals that he connected their minds to discover Luke's whereabouts. Holdo plans to evacuate the remaining Resistance members using small transport vessels. But Poe believes her plan is cowardly and futile and leads a mutiny. Leia recovers but also wishes to proceed with the evacuation and stuns Poe with a blaster. Holdo remains aboard the ship as a decoy to mislead Snoke's fleet as the others flee to an abandoned base on Crait. DJ buys his freedom by revealing the Resistance's plan to General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), and the First Order fleet fire at the evacuation transports, with many being destroyed. Kylo is ordered to kill Rey, but instead kills Snoke and defeats his Praetorian Guard with her help. Rey hopes that Kylo has abandoned the Dark Side, but he instead asks her to rule the galaxy with him. She refuses and they battle for control of Luke's lightsabre, with the weapon being broken. Holdo sacrifices herself by slicing through Snoke's flagship at lightspeed, crippling the First Order fleet. Rey escapes the destruction while Kylo declares himself Supreme Leader. BB-8 frees Finn and Rose who fight Phasma, she is defeated and falls to her death, and the pair join the survivors on Crait. When the First Order arrives, Poe, Finn, and Rose attack with obsolete speeders. Rey and Chewbacca draw TIE fighters away in the Millennium Falcon, while Rose stops Finn from sacrificing himself. The First Order penetrates the Resistance fortress using a siege cannon. The Resistance and First Order are surprised when Luke suddenly appears on the battlefield, allowing the surviving Resistance to escape. Kylo orders the First Order's forces to fire on Luke, but they fail to harm him. Kylo and Luke engages in a lightsabre duel, but when he manages to strike Luke, Kylo realises that Luke is not physically present, but projecting his image through the Force. Rey helps the remaining Resistance escape on the Falcon. Luke has exhausted his power and dies peacefully on Ahch-To, becoming one with the Force. Rey and Leia sense his death, and Leia tells Rey that the Resistance can rise again. At Canto Bight, the stable hands recount the story of Luke Skywalker, and one of the children is seen moving a broom with the Force and gazing into space.

The late great Fisher and Hamill remain as likeable as they were in the originals, Ridley and Boyega continue to delight with their breakout roles, Isaac is given a bit more to do, Driver gets more depth as the villain, and there is a terrific supporting cast, including recognisable talents like Dern, Gleeson, and Edmondson. I'm happy that this direct sequel continued to meet and fulfil my expectations, the story is well written and played out, the chase, fight and battle sequences are highly exciting, and the special effects are amazing, another triumph and I cannot wait for the conclusion in this new trilogy, a splendid science-fiction fantasy action adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Visual Effects, Best Original Score for John Williams, Best Sound Editing, and Best Sound Mixing, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Sound, and Best Special Visual Effects. Star Wars was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Outstanding!"
138,tt2527336,Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,9.0,"The Republic has fallen and the First Order are on the ascendance. The latter have caught up with the surviving rebels and managed to track them through hyperspace. There seems to be very little hope; the only tiny chance is if they manage to deactivate the tracking system. To do that Finn and mechanic Rose Tico must rack down a master hacker and then head to the lead First Order ship to deactivate the system. While this is going on Rey has found Luke Skywalker to seek his help... something he seems unwilling to give because of what happened when he tried to train his nephew Kylo Ren, formerly Ben Solo, as a Jedi. Somehow Rey and Kylo seem to be linked leading her to believe that she can bring him back to the light side of the force; it will also bring her to Kylo's master, Snoke.I know a lot of reviewers weren't too keen on this addition to the 'Star Wars' franchise but I really enjoyed it. There is lots of really impressive action and despite being almost two and a half hours long it didn't drag. I liked how it avoided the obvious in many ways; especially concerning the identity of Rey's parents. There are some flaws of course; without giving too many details it is hard to see how Finn and Rey survive when the hundreds of Stormtroopers surrounding them don't. There are a couple of other minor things but nothing the spoil my enjoyment. It was great to see Mark Hamill back for a substantial role as Luke has more than a tiny cameo. It was also great seeing Carrie Fisher as Leia, although it is bittersweet knowing it is her final role. The younger cast impress too; notably Daisy Ridley, as Rey; Adam Driver, as Kylo; John Boyega, as Finn and Kelly Marie Tran, as new character Rose. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of the franchise; it delivers the spectacle we have come to expect without just being a rehash of 'Empire Strikes Back'... it will be interesting to see what happens in 'Episode IX'."
139,tt2527336,Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,8.0,"Oh wow! Where to begin?First of all, then this movie was everything that ""The Force Awakens"" should have been and then some.I was blown away from what director Rian Johnson came up with for this eigth installment to the ""Star Wars"" saga, and I would say that the saga is now back on track after the terrible blow it suffered with the re-make of ""A New Hope"" that was essentially all that ""The Force Awakens"" turned out to be.The characters in the movie are more detailed and have more going on in terms of coherent storyline and events.The special effects in the movie were off the charts and it was such a thrill to be back in the ""Star Wars"" galaxy.""The Last Jedi"" really captured that ""Star Wars"" magic and essence of the established universe.Let's just have a quick run-through of the prominent characters that were in ""The Last Jedi"", shall we? Supreme Leader Snoke was a faceless, almost literally, character that had no background, and what happened to him in this movie was adequate because he was not an established character. I don't like the Kylo Ren character, and didn't like him in ""The Force Awakens"" either, but it was nice to see more of his background, and see the character evolve here in this movie. As for Finn, well he was just a generic hero-like character, as he was in ""The Force Awakens"", offering a bit of comedy to the movie. As for Rey, well I am not overly much a big fan, but she had some great evolution of character as well. It was such a blast to see Luke Skywalker return, and have a big role as it was a childhood hero. And as for Princess Leia, well I thought that the director would write her out of the storyline, but we will just have to wait and see. Phasma, well that wasn't an interesting character to begin with, so no great loss there. Poe Dameron did what he essentially did in ""The Force Awakens"", so there was not much growth there. As for Rose, well that seemed somewhat like a created-on-the-fly character. Benicio Del Toro's character wasn't even utilized anywhere near a satisfactory level, and the same went for Chewbacca.There definitely has been a lot of whining and crying about this movie. But hey, it is a movie, so I don't sympathize with all the fanboys crying about not getting what they wanted. This is a movie, and movies are meant to entertain. It is the director and writers vision and views that comes to fruition here, not the fanboys.However, all in all, ""The Last Jedi"" is a great Sci-Fi adventure that captured the ""Star Wars"" magic once more for the saga. I was more than genuinely entertained, and I am in no way discouraged from watching the forthcoming movies. I love ""Star Wars"" and have done so since the early 80's when I first watched ""A New Hope"", and I will continue to love this franchise.If you haven't already seen ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"", then I would highly recommend that you do so."
140,tt2527336,Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,3.0,"After George Lucas's execrable prequels and the mediocre The Force Awakens, I've learnt to keep my expectations low for any new Star Wars films in order to avoid total disappointment. Having just seen The Last Jedi, it appears that I haven't been keeping them low enough.The reasons for my loathing are the same as those noted in the countless scathing reviews here on IMDb, so I won't go into drawn out detail - suffice to say that the film frequently beggars belief, is massively bloated, defies logic and is full of misplaced humour (the worst moments being the horrible 'steam iron' gag and BB-8's handy coin launcher).3 out of 10, solely for the impressive special effects. Writer/director Rian Johnson shouldn't be allowed within 12 parsecs of another Star Wars sequel."
141,tt2527336,Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,,"I watched this at home on DVD from my public library. It has no extras at all but picture and sound are first rate as you would expect from George Lucas.Fortunately all this occurs in a galaxy far, far away so no matter what happens our own Milky Way galaxy will not be threatened. I have seen all the Star Wars movies and even though characters come and go this one still has a sensibility of story and action that pays tribute to the originals.Mark Hamill is again Luke Skywalker, now hoping to live the rest of his life quietly on a tiny, very remote island on a very remote world. In spite of that Daisy Ridley as Rey seeks him out, she needs training to help the resistance effort to save the galaxy. We don't get much of Rey's origin story but we do see she had a special connection to The Force.This was Carrie Fisher's last role before her unexpected death, she is General Leia Organa, commander of resistance troops. She and Han Solo have a son, Ben Solo, who has turned to the dark side, and taken the name Kylo Ren, played by Adam Driver .I see from the list of reviews many are being very brutal to this movie and giving it ratings of ""1"" or ""2"" which is totally bogus. This is an entertaining movie and the special effects are done very well. Its overall average IMDb rating is very appropriate."
142,tt2527336,Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,10.0,"Ive seen Last Jedi twice now and the second time went with my older brother (who is old enough to have owned original Return of the Jedi toys). He remarked (and I took for granted) John Williams's score once again being a highlight, and starting off on that point reminds me why Star Wars still has the adventure/operatic impact it does. The Last Jedi is full of sweeping action and tragedy and loss and hope, and Williams reflects that and heightens it, elevates it, into more than it was. We just always think, well, this is Johnny, but his achievement here is no less than any of his other compositions. For all of the attention to the psychology of the characters (as much as can happen in Star Wars, which is a fast-moving adventure serial), without Williams's themes it doesnt grab the punch. One day he will go into the great dissolve in the sky. I'm struck even more this time by how there are many, many character dynamics in this 150 minutes - even Benicio Del Toro's stuttering thief, who has the kind of grime and sleaze but charisma this needs, some originality here and there - and Johnson as a writer is able to juggle so many. I should have more or a gripe with his Poe only kinda sorta grows by the end (for all of his cocksureness, he knows well enough to leave a giant death-star-tech cannon alone at a certain point), but it's offset by how we get to see Isaac actually inhabit this guy (unlike last film when he was away most of the time). Every connection that should matter, from Luke to Rey to Rey and Kylo (a curious linkage by the way that makes me wonder about whether Snoke was saying truth or not when he commented on being the architect of their bond... A very small moment near the very end tells me he wasn't or at least not fully), Finn and Rose, Poe and Holdo (is she coming back in the next one? I have no clue, but her exit is easily the most breathtaking moment in this film and most of the Star Wars movies), and even Kylo and ""Admiral Hugs."" It might be a lot of skipping between the timelines, but the tension isn't lost from thread to thread. If anything seeing it again I admired more the tapping between tones, from the wide-eyed goofy (mixed with a tinge of melancholy for the exploited underclass) in the Casino city to the uneasy and veering on psychedelic bits on the island. Oh, and as a director Johnson gets the most bang for his buck as far as capturing indelible images and even visual poetry (and I dont mean how Lucas once tried to say it once upon a time). Only flaw: he could have even more if he slowed down for a beat or two (my one minor gripe pace wise, it's breathless in the storytelling often in this long but not overlong sit).This is wonderful work, funny, heartwarming and heartbreaking, and while with no twists that will especially change the fabric of pop culture, there are a couple that make enough of an impact to get a packed theater into excitement (but then again perhaps Johnson knows ironically people might go in *expecting* to get one of those bone-shattering/solar-plexus-damaging twists like in 'Empire'). And it has a strong take on what is wrong and right at the same time about legacy. You can't stick to everything in books that are older than dirt, but the impetus for keeping a balance in the force is a good one and may inspire those who are told from birth they should have none. This goes for Luke but it also goes for Kylo Ren, and his turn towards the dark side in this story is more subtle in some waye than that of his grandfather - what do you take with you and for all of the talk of God powers (and demonstrations, like the kick-you-in-the-ass climax), it's always down to choice in a given circumsrance, pure and simple.Thats a powerful message, especially for children, and if one takes it a political step further there are far greater parallels that can be drawn, but that would take a longer review to get into (suffice it to say if you can't make paralells between the Resistance and the First Order to what's going on in America and the UK and other points worldwide now, you're not paying enough attention). In other words as basic entertainment it's a blast that has steady direction, and as something political (as all art, or good art, should be), it kicks ass too. One question as I still am in awe of what Johnson was able to do as far as making a spectacular blockbuster film... Why didn't Laura Dern just take Oscar Isaac aside and tell him the plan to ger into the cloaked ships? He wouldve saved a lot of trouble, though ultimately the trip to the Casino planet for Finn and Rose *is* much more important than even I first thought. It really is key to setting up a lot of what's to come in movies beyond this which was clever given how it seemed like a silly diversion (was that Justin Theroux as the expert gambler? Looked like him). But anyway, just a minor gripe."
143,tt2527336,Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,10.0,"I had been a kid growing up watching the original Star Wars trilogy from the late '70/early '80s in movie theatres during their first release so I know about the excitement that often greets these movies though I also admit I've only watched Episode II when it came to the prequel trilogy. So it's that in mind that I write this review of the second in the latest trilogy and declare this was even better than The Force Awakens. First, Mark Hamill makes a welcome return as Luke Skywalker though not having the same attitudes as his previous portrayal. I actually found this quite refreshing as it gave Hamill new nuances of his characterization. I also liked many of the new characters introduced here. Also, John Williams has not lost his touch in once again scoring another series entry. He's always the best at what he's done and this is no exception! And finally, the late Carrie Fisher does herself proud in playing Princess General Leia one more time. I especially liked her scene with Luke near the end. Great final scene with both together one last time. So, overall, I loved The Last Jedi and have no hesitation saying so!"

145,tt2527336,Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,4.0,"Picking up where The Force Awakens left off, Rey meets Luke Skywalker and tries to convince him to help The Resistance. He is initially hesitant but eventually decides to train Rey in the way of The Force. However, Kylo Ren also wants to track down Skywalker, and uses Rey for that purpose. Meanwhile, The Resistance are locked in deadly battle with the First Order and, while they have some minor victories, it seems like a futile struggle.I'm not generally a Star Wars fan but to my surprise I enjoyed Episode VII - The Force Awakens. It grabbed my attention from the word go and held it all the way through. A rollicking adventure with engaging characters. Moreover, the blending of the old characters and the new was very well done, with the feeling that the torch had been passed to the new generation.Unfortunately, Episode VIII doesn't come close to the engagement, novelty and adventure of Episode VII. Its essentially one long action-drama, with little in the way of engagement or originality. The Rey-Kylo Ren relationship had potential but went nowhere new or interesting and was snuffed out pretty quickly. Them possibly working together held my attention but the intrigue was short-lived. The movie simply degenerated into action sequences after that.On the upside, no need to waste my time on Episode IX (Or X, or XI, or...)..."
146,tt2527336,Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,3.0,"I love the Star Wars franchise. I was so anxious to watch The Last Jedi especially how The Force Awakens ended and how good The Force Awakens was. I bought my tickets a month and a half in advance in anticipation of episode eight. As the movie started I was dialed in for the first 15 minutes then I noticed this subtle uneasiness in me like a disturbance in the force. It began with the interaction between Poe and Princess Leia. She made a comment and made a decision regarding Poe that I found a little unsettling. ""OK."" I thought. I didn't like that exchange but it's not a show stopper. The subtlety was that Leia was making it seem like the Rebels were in no need of heroes. They didn't need fighters anymore, they needed thinkers (or something akin to that). I took that little shift in philosophy in stride and kept eagerly watching. A couple of other small iniquities occurred but I soldiered forth watching with an open mind because it's ""Star Wars"".Then, there came the interaction between Rey and Luke Skywalker.Luke is part of movie folklore to me. Like many people have the one celebrity they'd like to meet: the one fictional character for me has always been Luke Skywalker. Luke was the first hero I'd seen wear black. He had piloting skills, light saber skills and could do Jedi mind tricks. He was the coolest.Fast forward nearly 40 years and now Luke is an old man. So what I'm expecting is an older, WISER Luke. If Luke is on a deserted planet then it must be for a very good reason. And if Rey found him, much like Luke found Yoda, then Luke will have so much to impart upon Rey. That's not quite what went down. They made Luke a sullen pessimistic old man that was ignorant of simple truths. He offered so little; to the movie and to Rey. He was a shell of his former self, he was only good at being the ex machina. The Luke Skywalker in this movie was NOT the Luke Skywalker I knew. The Luke Skywalker I know was killed in this movie.After seeing my fictional hero relegated to something unrecognizable I actually became bitter while watching the movie. There was almost nothing they could do to save the movie. And they didn't . In fact, it got worse. By the end the movie was more of what I should have saw coming: rebels running from the Republic and figuring out some remote yet heroic way to ward them off. And what added to the annoyingness of this movie is that they didn't know when or how to end it. What should have been the end was followed up by another half an hour mini movie with its own beginning, middle and end.But unlike The Last Jedi I know how to end this post. Don't waste your time."

After surviving Mr. Ren's twenty-one hundred gun salute, Luke Skywalker's astral projection seems pretty stumped about what to do for its next trick. Blow up a Death Star? No, that would fill Hyperspace with too much needless debris. Take over the wheel of the Millennium Falcon from Han Solo's icy grip? No, again, the chicks have beaten him to that assignment (though it could plausibly pass as a Wookie now to sit in the copilot's seat). Just hang out and chill with Yoda? Wrong again that would be. It's as if Dorothy has returned to Oz, only to find that the Cowardly Lion has died from old age, the Tinman has one foot in his grave, and the Scarecrow's coming down with Alzheimer's. Sounds pretty grim, Huh? Maybe the Disney folks can find a way to monetize Youth. With Today's CGI, why can't they hire fresh young blood to say the 5,132 different words making up 99% of all movie scripts while performing the 78 basic Screen Movements and 41 possible facial expressions in front of a green screen? Then, by copyrighting these exclusive and versatile young talents forever, they'll have stars just as durably ageless and incorruptible as Steamboat Willie (aka, ""Mickey Mouse"")."
148,tt2527336,Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,3.0,"The Last Jedi is a weak eighth installment, lacking the magic of all those before.While ""The Force Awakens"" had mostly the same group of characters, I found them much more likable in that film, especially Rey. ""The Force Awakens"" had build up with introduction to the new characters and humour, here we are just chucked in and I can't recall laughing other than with Chewbacca and the porgs. Some of the intended humour was bad also, Domhnall Gleeson's character for one. Kylo Ren was terrible, but he was also terrible in the last film. Luke and Leia brought nothing to the table, only annoyance. Luke appeared to be drained after his hologram showdown with Kylo, why did he have a bloody sit-down with Leia first and also not discuss what he's doing. Then you have Snoke and his pointless involvement and silly death. Rey, the main character at this point, did nothing. So there's possible upside in that regard, but I am not looking forward to Episode IX. Oh and John Boyega stole that looking move from Cuba Gooding Jr, when he first meets Rose."
149,tt2527336,Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,4.0,"Modern Disney - you know, the one that has to buy Pixar to gain any originality - has its fingerprints all over this one. There were great visuals, entertaining characters, and funny one-liners. Oh, and this one had inspirational messages: Anyone can be a hero, we fight out of love, failure is a teacher, etc. (however ham-fisted).The audience was there for the world-building and the advancement of the story. None of which really happened. So the audience focused on the string of plot holes, lapses in logic, and generally lack of anything new or interesting that was added to the Star Wars world. The Last Jedi is the cinematic reverse equivalent of fast food. Critics were more than happy with it because they came expecting a Transformers like CGI fest - they got that; the audience was expecting more. Plus after two movies we literally know nothing about Rey except that she is good at anything with little or no training. The only real spoiler I offer - given what happened on and off the set of the last two Star Wars films - is that the franchise is currently left in the same place as the British TV show Black Adder at the end of each season, minus Rowan Atkinson and the originality. I have to give it 4/10 stars just for the art design and technical expertise and nothing else. A big budget film like this could never be a 1 or a 2 out of ten. That's an Ed Wood film or ""Manos The Hands of Fate"" (don't ask). Likewise a 10/10 is Casablanca or The Godfather - when everything including acting, directing, depth of the plot and the ability to argue about themes, all come together such that the film still resonates years after it was made. This one made it about a third of the way between these two extremes."

I will admit the dialogue is weak and gets nowhere at times, the plot isn't as well thought out and felt convoluted at best, Haydn Christensen does give a truly abysmal performance as Anakin and although the presence of Jar Jar Binks was toned down here his presence anywhere seemed jarring. Still despite the major flaws, it is a marvel to look at with stunning sets and impeccable CGI. The battle sequences are well choreographed, the pace is somewhat brisker than in Phantom Menace and the performances with the exception of Christensen are very good.Natalie Portman is quite captivating as Queen Padma, and displays a lot of emotional depth. Frank Oz is excellent as always as Yoda, and Ewen MacGregor is more at home here than he was in Phantom Menace. There is no doubt though that the acting honours go to Christopher Lee as the villainous Count Dooku. Then again, Lee is an exceptional actor who can act anything you throw at him. Plus John Williams' music was outstanding. Overall, a decent movie while the weakest of the Star Wars franchise. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
151,tt0121765,Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,5.0,"It was with low hopes that I set out to the cinema to watch the latest offering from George Lucas, considering the out-and-out failure of The Phantom Menace, a film which helped to sour the image of the bearded god for thousands of former fans. In the three years since, Lucas seems to have learned something about film-making and has perhaps even managed to recapture some of the magic which was missing from the first movie. The characters have more interactions this time around, the plot isn't as boring and as a whole the film holds together a lot better than it rightfully should.Most of the flaws from The Phantom Menace are once again evident, but not as drastic in this offering. Lucas spends more time developing supporting characters to good effect, leaving the leads feeling all too wooden and unrealistic. Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen are definitely the two worst things in this movie, and their slow, cheesy romantic interludes feel a whole world away from the Star Wars universe. They don't belong here, and serve only to drag down the pacing in spots. Both actors fare badly with their dialogue and become laughable at times.Thankfully, other characters have improved somewhat. Since The Phantom Menace, Ewan McGregor has developed in his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi and actually does feel something like a younger Alec Guinness, unlike last time. He seems more relaxed and more natural in his part as the mentor rather than the learner. Elsewhere, Samuel Jackson returns as ass-kicking Jedi Knight Mace Windu, and this time gets to wield the purple light saber he's always talking about in interviews to good effect. Yoda's back too, this time fully animated with CGI and pretty realistic with it, and he even has a few genuine surprises up his sleeve for the finale. Unfortunately the rest of the council, which includes Ian McDiarmid and a fresh-faced Jimmy Smits, are barely on screen. R2D2 and C3P0 are present and more like the lovable buffoons of old than they were last time.The special effects are fantastic and go a long way in making the movie worth watching. The other-wordly vistas are nicely scenic and the backgrounds more realistic than before. Once again there are a plethora of partially-successful CGI aliens and the like filling the scenes, although (thank the gods) Jar Jar Binks is mostly ignored this time. Up until the last forty-five minutes of this film, the material is mostly harmless filler, bolstered by some adequate action scenes and intriguing characters. The last forty-five minutes consistent of a huge action sequence which begins like Gladiator, turns into Braveheart, and finishes with a climatic light saber fight between Christopher Lee and Yoda which is equal parts cheesy and equal parts cool. Yep, the grand old man of horror Christopher Lee appears in this film as bad guy Count Dooku (shame about that name) and manages to be a lot more menacing than last film's Darth Maul, although once more you can't help but feel he's underused seeing as he doesn't turn up until an hour into the film.The action sequences of the climax are expertly choreographed and full of beautiful special effects of things exploding, people fighting and dying and hundreds of CGI-created soldiers going about their business and shooting it out to the death. My favourite moment is the arena fight with Anakin, Padme, and Obi-Wan, which introduces three excellently-animated monsters and some ferocious fighting. From then on it doesn't let up and the ending is a lot more involving and exciting than it has any right to be. If only the rest of the film could have been of this standard, then we might have been looking at a classic. As it stands, Attack of the Clones is half bad (full of revealing mistakes and inherent dumbness), half good (impressive as brain candy but nothing more), leaving it a mildly impressive but far from brilliant spectacle piece."

The performances are also slightly better this time out and the added bonus of Christopher Lee also works well. The biggest advantage of this film is the action scenes are a whole lot better, especially the early race scene as well as the final forty-minutes, which are full of excitement. I really think a better director (cough Spielberg) could have done more with this film but what can you do. The film could have also been helped by cutting at least twenty minutes."

The expositions are all done in tired uninteresting way. There is a lot of walking-and-talking and sitting in a circle. It is all terrible and I would suggest fast-forwarding several sections of the movie.On the other hand, the CGI continues to be great. The best is Kamino. That world is sci-fi heaven. I love the aliens. I love Jango Fett and Anakin is nowhere to be found. McGregor gets to leave behind that dead weight. I also like the Blade-Runner-like lower levels of Coruscant although that bar should have been a lot seedier. It has too much of a sports bar feel.

155,tt0121765,Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,6.0,"""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones"" is the fifth of so far seven Star Wars films and the second film from the second trilogy, which makes it film number 2 as well in terms of chronology. The director is once again George Lucas and he is also one of the writers as usual. The cast includes a handful names that defined the second era of Star Wars films, such as Portman, Christensen and McGregor. And of course all the known characters that I won't have to mention here by name.I may be a bit biased here as sci-fi is definitely not my favorite genre and I also never have been a really great Star Wars fan, not even of the old films. But still, there are sequences here where it was easy for me to appreciate the film. But the problem is that these sequences are far from frequent enough for a film that runs for considerably over 2 hours. And this is why I would say that this film we have here stays a work that has clearly not fulfilled its potential in terms of the epicness it tries to deliver. This refers to the script mostly, but also to the acting. But the script is the bigger problem. At some point, it feels they just try to include as many fantastic creatures as possible, give them a punchline here and there and hope this is enough so that people may overlook the deficits in storytelling and appreciate this film as something close to a comedy. But with this approach, it can never be a great work.The key is walking the fine line between fantasy and reality (in Star Wars usually the struggles in terms of politics) without getting too absurd or too uninteresting in any of these departments. It is definitely a small line, but they have succeeded before, but here they do not. The quantity and quality of new characters, the non-human ones, is just far from where I wish it could have been. And with the human ones, there aren't that many interesting moments either, so sometimes it seems that they really went way past the franchise's peak. This only refers to acting and (especially) story though as the visual side is once again very impressive, which makes it a much much better viewing at a theater or on a gigantic screen in your home theater and this is certainly where you should see it.This film was nominated for an Oscar in the special effects category, but lost to ""Lord of the Rings"", the other big (Christopher Lee) thing back then. And not only the effects are pretty great, also the costumes, sets and cinematography are as convincing as in all the other Star Wars films. But the high level in there also shows how mediocre the script is and how important a good script is because if a film only or mostly delivers on the visual side, then it still cannot make up for major flaws in the story or just the lack of a convincing story altogether that has you on the edge of your seat. And this is the feeling I had here. The film kept drifting slowly forward, but there was nothing really that wowed me or really impressed me to an extent where I would say I have to see this film again soon. You can maybe call it an example of ""style over substance"". But it is not a failure or even a weak film. It is a solid work that just is underwhelming in the face of how much it cost. I do recommend the watch. Cautiously."
156,tt0121765,Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,8.0,"Ten years after the invasion of Naboo, the Galactic Republic is facing a Separatist movement and the former queen and now Senator Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman) travels to Coruscant to vote on a project to create an army to help the Jedi to protect the Republic. On the arrival, she escapes from an attempt to kill her and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) are assigned to protect her. They chase the shape-shifter Zam Wessell (Leeanna Walsman) but she is killed by a poisoned dart before revealing the identity of who hired her. The Jedi Council assigns Obi-Wan Kenobi to discover the bounty hunter that has tried to kill Amidala and Anakin to protect her in Naboo. Obi-Wan discovers that the dart is from the planet Karmino and he heads to the remote planet. He finds an army of clones that has been under production for years for the Republic and that the bounty hunter Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison) was the matrix for the clones. Meanwhile Anakin and Amidala fall in love with each other and he has nightmares with his mother. They travel to his planet Tattoine to see his mother and he discovers that she has been abducted by the evil Tusken Raiders. Anakin finds his mother dying and he kills all the Tusken tribe including the women. Obi-Wan follows Jango Fett to the planet Geonosis where he finds who is behind the Separatist movement. He transmit his discoveries to Anakin since he cannot reach the Jedi Council. Who is the leader of the Separatist movement? Will Anakin receive Obi-Wan's message? And the secret love between Anakin and Amidala will succeed?""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones"" is the second chapter of the saga with great action, but also a boring romance. The action scenes are breathless, with many battles. The romance between Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala is annoying in many parts and weird since Amidala was a queen when Anakin was a nine year-old boy. Christopher Lee, the favorite villain of many films, is perfect as usual. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Star Wars: Episódio II - Ataque dos Clones"" (""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones"")Note: The last time I saw this film was on 17 December 2002."
157,tt0121765,Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,,"An attempt on the life of Senator Padmé leads to Jedi knights Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker being assigned to protect her. Further information on the assassin leads Obi-Wan to travel to a distant constellation while Anakin and Padmé go undercover to travel to her home planet for safety. While Anakin and Padmé begin to fall for each other, Obi-Wan discovers a factory planet producing a clone army for the Republic. With events appearing to be being controlled by powerful external sources the Jedi's find themselves faced with a battle against a further force within the Trade Federation.Basically think of all the areas where the Phantom Menace failed and write them all down  too dry plot-wise, too childish, no comedy or fun, poor characters, no drive, Jar Jar Binks! Now just imagine that Lucas had had a ham-fisted attempt at improving on them and actually did an OK job of it. Where the original Star Wars films got darker with the second instalment so to does Attack of the Clones. This dark element comes through in many ways. Mainly we have Anakin's shift towards the dark side as he begins to wander from the code of the Jedi by displaying anger, arrogance, impatience, lust. His descent into violence due to personal circumstances marks a dark moment in the film. Also we have the Jedi beginning to lose power while the dark side continue to grow in influence. This makes the whole political sub-plot much better than Phantom Menace where it was dull and going nowhere but doing it very slowly. Here you can see the strands come together as Darth Sidious continues to influence events with the help of Darth Tyranus. The fact that all the pieces are being to fall into place makes this even better  we can see actions begin that cause the situation in Star Wars 4, and we have the beginnings to things that will see the downfall of the Jedi in episode 3; this at least makes the narrative more interesting and, because it implies bigger things, more engaging.However this dark edge is tempered by a new concept to those only familiar with episode 1  occasional fun. The romance subplot is a bit clunky and unconvincing but it doesn't slow it down as much as the trailers suggested it may. Although the romance turns dark it makes for a nice contrast with Obi-Wan's more action story that occurs at the same time. The film is funnier for two main reasons  firstly Obi-Wan is allowed to be more relaxed and adventurous, and two  the droid versions of Laurel & Hardy return in the shape of the ever great C3-P0 and R2-D2. The effects and battles are better here too but still suffer from Lucas loving his computer more than he does his characters; however as a summer blockbuster to pack multiplexes, the action works well. There are some bigger downsides yes it all looks good but some of it is a little silly. For example the 'car' chase near the start sees our Jedi heroes falling through the sky for 30 odd seconds just to land on another vehicle with perfect timing I know they have the force but that's pushing it isn't it? Likewise other bits just step over the limit of what is acceptable as 'real' even in sci-fi.The performances and the characters have improved but generally they are still delivering lines as if they were quoting God. MacGregor is better because he is allowed to have a character instead of a totally dry cut-out like episode 1, but it is still a bit of an impression. Likewise Anakin is much better here (could he have been worse?) and Christensen tries hard  at first simmering with arrogance but later letting rage and frustration become his master for the first time; he is still a bit too wooden and a bland actor for me but at least he is better than Lloyd. Lee and McDiarmid make very good puppet-masters, while Jackson clearly enjoys having more to do than in episode 1. Yoda is good (despite looking silly in his battle) and given the part he deserves while Smits is really underused. To continue the 'cool bad guy' strand Morrison makes a cool Jango Fett  as well as allowing the film to carry through the themes of parenthood and family ties through his son Boba. Unfortunately Jar Jar Binks is back in this but at least the film shows some irony in the fact that it Binks that basically opens the door for the creation of the Empire and the fall of the Republic.Personally the main improvement is the linkage are not only being made with the events of part 4 but that they are now heavily up on screen. Although it is all a bit basic and simplistic (no time for complex thematic changes with all that CGI to create!) it still has moments - the most powerful for me is near the end where massive events unfold before the watching Jedi council and the music smoothly moves into the dark Empire theme tune from part 4  showing clearly that this is one of the major leaps towards the breakdown of the Republic and the creation of the Empire. It may feed off nostalgia as much as be a genuine moment, but it did work. Overall an improvement on Episode 1 but still a bit weak in many areas. It all depends now on the final episode (as it always did) to raise the level again and actually make a strong film that really lets the series go out on a bang rather than just making these new films one big bad idea."
158,tt0121765,Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,7.0,"For your behind that is. The second (actually is the 5th film Lucas shot) part/Episode of Star Wars has a running time of over two hours. That's something you have to sit through and I don't even go into the romance part (which is much criticized by many), but I will go into the CGI this time.And that's all because of Yoda (in Episode IV - VI he was a Frank Oz Muppet)! There is especially one scene at the end of the movie, that ""kicks *ss"" and is worth your while alone! And one of the reasons I rated the movie higher, than I myself would've thought. This scene (which I won't spoiler, if you haven't seen the movie yet) is also the reason other people disliked the movie ... So maybe I'm a bit too euphoric, but I can't help it! (other than that, there is not much to say about acting or character development imho)"
159,tt0121765,Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,8.0,"This might be the most intricately detailed and plotted of all the Star Wars films, but judging from all the negative reviewers on this board, I have to wonder if they paid attention long enough to understand what was going on. Conspiracy and double crosses abound, with the introduction of Christopher Lee's character Count Dooku leading the separatist movement against the Republic. Then there's Chancellor Palpatine pulling strings that will eventually give rise to the supremacy of the Sith and the Dark Side of the Force. His flattery of young Anakin Skywalker is recognition of the Jedi's powerful potential, and is intended to hasten his corruption.For this viewer, that was the real story in ""Attack of the Clones"", and even though the relationship between Anakin (Hayden Christensen) and Amidala (Natalie Portman) was necessary for events of ""A New Hope"", that was secondary for the moment. At about the time of events of ""The Phantom Menace"" ten years earlier, we come to learn that a clone army has been commissioned by former Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas for service to the Republic. Even more fascinating is the fact that all of the clones are descendant from a single original host, Jango Fett. Fett's death later in the Arena against the assembled Jedi Masters offers a convincing hint to the reason behind his son's chosen profession as a galaxy bounty hunter.As for the romance between Anakin and Padme, and even though there were hints of it in 'Menace', it was still somewhat difficult reconciling their relationship given the age difference and their chosen paths in life. The film handled that progression in a manner that made sense, but not enough to explain Padme's acceptance of Anakin's berserk rampage on Tatooine in response to his mother's death. It was at that moment I feel, that Anakin became Darth Vader, even if the formality was left to ""Revenge of the Sith"".On a lighter and more technical note, the CGI effects and action sequences of this episode were the most stunning yet, not even accounting for the battle scenes. The night time chase scene at the start of the film to catch the assassin Zam was incredibly detailed, looking more exceptional on my wide screen home TV than I even remembered it in the theater. And say, did anyone else get the impression that the inhabitants of Kamino resembled Whitley Strieber's aliens?Anyway, I enjoyed this installment of the series even if the reviews are mixed and I find myself in a minority. I can only assume that the nay sayers operate somewhere beyond the Outer Rim, just outside the Rishi Maze."
160,tt0121765,Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,6.0,"OK, we all know that this is where Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) has become an adult and is starting to develop Darth-like qualities. What more to say? I still assert that Jar Jar Binks was the coolest character. I know, everyone's going to hate me for saying that, but I don't care (why do people think that he sounds Jamaican?; I thought that he sounded Cajun).As for the rest of the characters, they're all doing what they can, but given the epic scale of the story, there's not much that they can do except say their lines. Unlike ""The Phantom Menace"", I did have a better sense of the plot in ""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones"". Worth seeing, even if it is sort of a video game."
161,tt0121765,Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,5.0,"Continuing the prequels to the original trilogy, from Razzie nominated director George Lucas, Anakin Skylwalker (Razzie winning Hayden Christensen) has grown up, and is now learning apprentice to Obi-Won Kenobi (Ewan McGregor). In this film, the Queen has quit, and is now Senator Padmé Amidala (Razzie nominated Natalie Portman), and is endangered by bounty hunter, later identified as Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison), and it is Anakin's job to keep an eye on her. Along the way though, he breaks a Jedi rule by falling in love. Meanwhile, Obi-Won searches for the bounty hunter, and finds a planet where cloning of troops is taking place, apparently for the Rebels. Anakin feels very strongly about his mother, Shmi Skywalker-Lars (Pernilla August), so he takes Padmé with him to his home planet to find her, and he manages to find her, in dying moments, so he kills the desert people that kidnapped her (a step towards the Dark Side). Obi-Won is also on the planet, and he meets former Jedi, turned to Dark Side, Count Dooku/Darth Tyranus (Christopher Lee), and the battle soon after gets under way, as the clones (on the good side) attack the villains. In the end, the war is over for now, Anakin gets a replacement hand (that he lost), and he and Padmé marry. Also starring Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu, The Muppets' Frank Oz (aka Miss Piggy and Fozzie Bear) as Yoda (now computer generated), Ian McDiarmid as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and Ahmed Best as Jar Jar Binks. This along with the other two are never going to be as good for story, dialogue (which is ridiculous) or 'magic' as the originals, but the special effects are never disappointing. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Screenplay, Worst Screen Couple for Christensen and Portman and Worst Remake or Sequel. Sir Christopher Lee was number 31, Samuel L. Jackson number 11, and Ewan McGregor number 9 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Lee was number 13, and McGregor number 2 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, Star Wars was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and the film was number 65 on The Ultimate Film. Worth watching!"
162,tt0121765,Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,6.0,"This was the only Star Wars film of the six in the series that disappointed me. I still like it, overall, but the teen romance didn't do anything for me and took away from the normally more interesting story lines. The romance doesn't take up a lot of time but it features a lot of stupid dialog and leads to a stupid finish in the film.On the positive side, this film offers good action scenes and excellent artwork and special effects. Some of the scenes are just stunning to view. Some, to be fair, look too computer-generated but overall it's a fun movie to look at, as it is to hear with some outstanding surround sound. The better the speakers (and a sub-woofer), the more awesome this movie. I'd like to see this on large-screen plasma set, too, to get the full effect of the visuals. The more the series went on, the better the technology to present them and this was the second-last of the saga.""Attack Of The Clones"" is the only Star Wars episode I have only seen once. Perhaps a second look will bring it up to some of the others, especially now that I am so familiar with the whole story."
163,tt0121765,Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,7.0,"While this film is by no means a masterpiece I'll always have a soft spot for it as it was the first film I ever saw on DVD. It is a step up from the previous instalment with a better story and more excitement.Set a decade after the events in The Phantom Menace this film has a darker tone; we see far less of comedy relief Jar Jar Binks and Anakin is no longer a child but an almost fully trained Jedi. As the film opens we learn that Padmé is no longer the queen but the senator representing Naboo and somebody is trying to kill her. Obi-Wan and Anakin are assigned to protect her and in doing so learn that a weapon used was made on the planet Kamino which strangely appears in no records.Obi Wan heads to the site Kamino is meant to be Anakin takes Padmé back to Naboo where they grow closer then they should. On Kamino Obi Wan discovers that a vast army of clones is being prepared apparently at the request of a Jedi who had died ten years ago. Also there is the man this army was cloned from, a bounty hunter named Jango Fett, and his son Boba. When Obi Wan attempts to take him back to be questioned by the Jedi council he manages to escape but not before Obi Wan can put a tracking device on his ship which enables him to follow Jango to the planet Geonosis where a droid army is being constructed.Meanwhile back on Naboo Anakin is being haunted by dreams of his mother and decides he must return to Tatooine to help her. There he learns that she is no longer a slave and has got married, unfortunately a month before she was captured by Tuskan Raiders. He sets off to rescue her but is too late as she dies shortly after he finds her, in a fit of blind rage he slaughters everybody in the encampment.On returning to his ship he learns that Obi Wan has been captured on Geonosis so along with Padmé he heads there to attempt a rescue but this doesn't go according to plan and they too are captured and sentenced to death along with Obi Wan. They manage to break free but are still trapped in a large arena with three deadly creatures trying to kill them thankfully Mace Windu and the other Jedi arrive to help them fight the battle droids.Most of the major characters in film appeared in the previous film although Anakin is now played by Hayden Christensen. His character changed quite a lot too, instead of being a fun loving young boy he has become a whining teenager. The CGI seemed better than the previous film thus the battle scenes were much more believable. The dialogue has also improved but still contains several less than impressive one-liners, the romantic scenes between Padmé and Anakin don't seem very believable proving that George does special effects not people.If you liked The Phantom Menace or even thought it was just okay then I think this a film you would enjoy. I would certainly recommend watching that film before viewing this. The darker tone of this means it might not be suitable for very young children."
164,tt0121765,Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,6.0,"While episode two is definitely as step up from the abysmal episode one, then it is not fully up in pace, and it sort of feels like a space version of ""Titanic""; a way too long love story.The best part of ""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones"" is the fact that they toned down Jar Jar Binks to an acceptable level.""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones"" introduces a bunch of important characters and do focus on the storytelling. And it is entertaining from start to end, offering a lot of flavor to the ""Star Wars"" universe.The effects and Visuals are, as always, impressive. And the importance of the Visuals is what add that special atmosphere to the ""Star Wars"" universe. However, it is a shame that they opted for CGI effects more than actual practical effects.Personally, I think Hayden Christensen is as talented as a Christmas tree and is poorly cast for the role of young Anakin Skywalker, because it is a very prominent character in the ""Star Wars"" universe. However, Ian McDiarmid really is amazing in the role of Palpatine (and even more so in episode three). But all in all, the cast were great and did fantastic jobs with each their given roles and characters.This is a love story in the ""Star Wars"" universe, although an important movie in the ""Star Wars"" lore, but not quite fully having attained the magic of the original trilogy."
165,tt0121765,Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,3.0,"Rather than listen to the desperate pleas of millions of Star Wars fans worldwide, George Lucas ploughs ahead with Attack of the Clones in precisely the same manner that made The Phantom Menace a disappointment of star destroyer proportions: there's even more boring political subterfuge, even more dreadful CGI, even more ridiculous OTT action sequences (worst bits being Obi Wan and Anakin in pursuit of an assassin and the very silly droid factory sequence), and even more bloody Jar Jar Binks!!And if all that doesn't make you want to hurl yourself into the nearest available Sarlacc pit in a fit of despair, then the badly written, poorly acted, sappy burgeoning romance between Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala will probably do the trick.About the only things that Lucas does right are to cast Hayden Christensen as the now-grown up Anakin, because his lousy acting perfectly complements the wooden performance given by Jake Lloyd in TPM, and to get Natalie Portman out of those bloody stupid queen outfits and into something a little sexier—I'm not particularly a fan of Ms. Portman, finding her to be 'classically pretty' rather than smoking hot, but I have to admit that she does look rather delicious in her tight white outfit with impossibly toned midriff on display."
166,tt0121765,Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,,"This second prequel is similar to the first, but here Jar-Jar Binks isn't as obnoxious and his short screen time didn't detract too much. The story is silly, a far alien planet is manufacturing an army of clones of a bounty hunter and the Jedi knights have to travel to keep peace. There is a tremendous final battle scene, a bit over long and over done. No 'travel time' is depicted anywhere in the movie, so we in effect have people traveling many, many light-year distances in a very short time. Plus, when they communicate over very great distances, it is virtually instantaneous like a cell phone call. I suppose they figured out how to greatly speed up light speed. My bigger complaint is the acting. Natalie Portman was not a good choice. Even though I am a fan of hers, and she was just perfect as the mature little girl in movies like 'Beautiful Girls' and 'Leon, the Professional', in the 'Star Wars' movies her acting is very wooden, her changes of vocal and facial expression are almost nonexistent. Although she is striking in her tight white costume, she comes across as just an older version of her little girl characters. It could be that she is simply very limited as an actress. However, Ewan McGregor once again was very well cast as Obi-Wan. I enjoyed the movie for what I intended, just a fun movie with a great sound track and gorgeous images. However in total it is a silly, simple movie and just a shadow of the movies which represent the original Star Wars Trilogy."
167,tt0121765,Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,4.0,"I say that comment in full understanding that this film isn't perfect; the love story at times reminded me of something out of a Hallmark love movie, and Hayden Christensen as the padewan Anakin shows how the right looks and attitudes still need some better acting choices to make it work right. Yet, after viewing it in an almost packed theater, and a few times since at home, I am assured it is a return to form after the very good but lacking TPM. Director/Co-writer George Lucas returns to the vivacity and great visual splendor he had in his original trilogy, and thank goodness, Jar Jar Binks was kept very minimal here. This time there's room for some new creations, though more than anything it's more of a mystery movie than anything else- also one of loss.I know I shouldn't give away spoilers, and the one line summary might give away enough, but I will say that it was a better idea than I expected to see Yoda in computer animation. Oz's original puppetry can't be touched, but with all things considered the animation team and designers matched up to the work that was cut out for them. Whether you view this movie in regular projection or digital or in a full-screen TV cut is irrelevant. Lucas just filmed it in digital film to give those in digital theaters a bit more of a kick and if you see it on a regular screen won't matter in difference. Bottom line, if you felt a little cheated from Phantom Menace, this will bring back the believer in you that a story can be told in absorbing and cool fashion while delivering awesome graphics and action, not to mention a fantastic lot of new visuals that help tell a basically good story. That it still has a couple of acting ticks should try to be overlooked"
168,tt0121765,Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,5.0,This second Star Wars film of the second trilogy irons out some of the problems that were highlighted in the first new film and manages to be an entertaining enough film.Lucas is a good director but struggles to write naturalistic dialogue and therefore some of the dialogue his characters spout sounds clunky and weak.The acting is by and large good with the mix of action and comedy being more equally balanced and visually the film is stunning.Those who are opposed to this new trilogy will find nothing to alter their opinions but my opinion of this film is that it acts as both an improvement from the first new film and also as a good set up for the third part.Some will love these new films while others will hate them for the simple fact that they are not the much loved originals.

Anakin has always admired Obi-Wan, but his heart is edging to the Dark Side while professing his love for the now Senator Padme Amidala(Natalie Portman).

170,tt0121765,Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,9.0,"The second prequel to the original Star Wars trilogy takes place ten years after the events depicted in Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is an epic space opera film directed by George Lucas and written by Lucas and Jonathan Hales. It is the fifth film to be released in the Star Wars saga and the second in terms of the series' internal chronology.Now 20, young Anakin Skywalker is an apprentice to respected Jedi knight Obi-Wan Kenobi. Unusually powerful in the Force, Anakin is also impatient, arrogant, and headstrong -- causing his mentor a great deal of concern. The pair are ordered to protect Padme Amidala, the former queen of the planet Naboo, now representing her world in the Galactic Senate. Someone is trying to assassinate her on the eve of a vote enabling Supreme Chancellor Palpatine to build a military force that will safeguard against a growing separatist movement led by mysterious former Jedi Count Dooku. After another attempt on Padme's life, Obi-Wan and Anakin separate. The young Jedi and Padme fall in love as he escorts her first to the security of Naboo and then to his home world of Tatooine, where the fate of his mother leads him to commit an ominous atrocity. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan travels to the secretive planet Kamino and the asteroid-ringed world of Geonosis, following bounty hunter Jango Fett and his son, Boba, who are involved in an operation to create a massive army of clones. A vicious battle ensues between the clones and Jedi on one side and Dooku's droids on the other, but who is really pulling the strings in this galactic conflict? Clones is far from perfect, but when it clicks, it revives the old spirit that made a generation become so obsessed with all things Star Wars in the first place.While it lacks the quality of Empire's script and performances, it is the most visually enthralling of the series so far.It is certainly better than the childish Phantom Menace and the magic has definitely been recaptured.The acting was good as Christensen is a winning mix of sultry and sulky as the now older Anakin, while McGregor is finally beginning to relax as the mentor who understandably refuses to treat his moody pupil like a grown-up.But they all end up being upstaged by the jaw-dropping skills of a CGI creation: Yoda. Lucas has never been able to conjure another Han Solo, a character who could, with simply a wink, remind us that this was just an overgrown Saturday afternoon serial and worse a sort of movie we once loved and then outgrew. Although the scale of it is thrilling,it's too bad the movie is so muddled on so many different levels.But nevertheless,it was an improvement over The Phantom Menace."
171,tt0121765,Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,,"Spoilers herein.A gifted young man studies under a master and has a natural advantage over him. He has some early success and is attracted to the dark side. Thereafter, he engages in huge projects peopled by relatively mindless clones. His motives are turgid, and though many people are swept up in his enterprise, he ultimately fails.That's George Lucas, who stole much of the plot of Star Wars from the master filmmaker Kurosawa, even down to details of the storm trooper uniforms. But no one knew because Kurosawa's film was languishing in Japan. With a bunch of new effects plus some sophomoric Joseph Campbell mythology he was able to fake the first film. Knowing his limits, he assigned the writing and directing of the next two to others. They are by far the best of the five.Then by some hubris, he takes full control. No one can tell him that he is comparatively talentless, and the result -- though expertly marketed -- is a dud. There's no soul to this project. As with `The Cell,' the effects are lavish but use all sorts of clashing metaphors and philosophies. You already know that the writing and acting completely stink. I'm very easy to please. Often, just youthful experimentation will do it if exuberant, like `Gummo.'But I suppose that this project had so many people involved in every shot that they had to be imagined at the lowest common denominator. That means that no cinematic thrill appeared until the very end. But that last swordfight, especially the part before Yoda appears, is excellent. Shot on the same set as Moulin Rouge, and stealing the blocking from that film, and `Crouching Tiger.' The camera is a dancer, acting as the hidden master behind the drama. Oh if only the whole thing could have been so adventuresome with the camera!Speaking of which, Ewan has been in three of my top ten films of the last decade. His two Lucas films are not among them. (Moulin Rouge!' `The Pillow Book' `Black Hawk Down').Cat's eye comments follow:Serious science fiction readers have been watching these recent episodes carefully. The formula for multi-installment epics is pretty rigid. Successive layers of conspiring power are revealed, and at the end is a surprise layer. The closer you get to the end, the more are the clues of what that layer is, and the game becomes one of detective work.One can easily see where this is going. At the first layer is a conspiracy of politicians and merchants. Then we discover that they are mere tools of a larger battle between the Force and the `Dark Side.' Next we will discover another layer of what creates the Force and the Dark Side and are playing with them just as they play with `mere' beings. That force is machines. Notice these clues:-- The Jedi clearly are blinded to obvious signs around them. This is because the force is controlled by machines -- nanotech machines in their bloodstream communicating with each other. This was introduced in the last episode.-- A solar system cannot be ignored. It can be caused to disappear from the library's computers (by conspiring machines), but its gravity and mass are essential for navigation, and this would be done by computers. So the computers know about the cloner planet and keep that knowledge from humans. Also they inhibit the Jedi from reasoning clearly about it.-- The battle in this episode is clearly thrown by the robots, though they are outnumbered. Consider: machines capable of designing and building other machines who ARE weapons and who can communicate directly with each other -- and these are against humans who communicate bluntly (through machines) and who must operate weapons.-- Taking over of Skywalker includes making him part machine.Prediction: next episode, we will discover the force is the result of emergent complex system behavior of nanomachines that comprise a massive distributed computer. They permeate the Jedi's blood and are manipulating events so that humans destroy each other while leaving a legacy of machines to populate the universe. Presumably in episodes seven or eight, we would have gotten even higher, something like Stars as pantranscendent beings."
172,tt0121765,Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,,"Spoilers herein.This comment pertains to the edition of `Episode 2' remastered for Imax. My experience with the original viewing of this project was painful, from the horsey acting to the lack of imagination, to the really boring camera. The one unugly element of the film was some of the effects. I thought the big screen would help.No, it doesn't. All the previously-mentioned flaws are merely exaggerated. Because the entire film was digitally captured at 35mm, the blowup is not at all sharp like it would have been from real film. Its downright blurry. My theater messed up the sound, and I understand from others that the transition from Lucas' own of proprietary brand was not matched.But the surprise was how bad the effects looked. Many, many sequences that passed on the small big screen looked patently fakey on the big big screen: paintings, mismatched shadows, poor composites, sketchy background action.If you love film, stay away.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 4: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."
173,tt0121765,Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,7.0,"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is written and directed by George Lucas. It's the fifth Star Wars film to be released but the second in terms of story chronology. It stars Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee, Temuera Morrison & Ian McDiarmid. Music is scored by John Williams and cinematography is by David Tattersall. Set 10 years after the events featured in The Phantom Menace, the story sees the Galactic Republic under threat from separatists and a civil war looms. As Naboo Senator Padme Amidala is in danger of assassination, Jedi Padawan Skywalker is assigned to protect her. Meanwhile, Obi-wan Kenobi makes the worrying discovery of a clone army, a discovery that spells chaos for the galaxy.Now that the dust has settled on the prequel trilogy, it seems that Attack of the Clones is the one of the six film's that is most unliked by the fans. Which on structure terms is perhaps understandable given its heavy leaning towards the romantic strand between Amidala and Annakin (they are no Han & Leia that's for sure). Yet for all its problems (script/dialogue/acting/CGI mania) it's a marginally better film than Phantom Menace; nicely whetting the appetite for part three as well. If you can negotiate the mundane periods and accept it's merely the bridge to a better part of the film galaxy? Then it's a more palatable experience.Lucas has thankfully learnt some lessons from his first instalment (for example it's practically bye bye Binksy), but being the episode in which so much has to be set up in the franchise (reasons for love/hate/politics/family ties), Lucas is hand-tied as to how he can please the masses; and you feel that away from blunderbuss action he's not very comfortable directing such dialogue driven passages of play. However, the characters are now better formed, with the likes of McGregor looking more at ease playing such an iconic role, and if it's action you want, then you get payed up in full with colourful carnage: particularly for monster smack down time in a gladiatorial arena. Bonuses see Jackson more prominent as an ass kicker, Lee delicious as the villainous Count Dooku and Yoda (with a digital upgrade) makes a telling mar;, these are things that greatly improve the final third of the piece. While the print (it's all shot on HD Digital) positively sparkles in a way that insists you see it on the best available format you can.After the mixed reaction to Phantom Menace, and with it vying for punters in 2002 with Spider-Man, Harry Potter and the second Lord of the Rings, Attack of the Clones suffered at the box office in terms of financial expectation. For even tho it made around about $500 million in Worldwide profit, it remains (allowing for adjusted inflation) the lowest performing Star Wars film in the series. Revisits to the film show it to still have the same old flaws, but it's far from being a bad film. It has the darker edges that were required (ala Empire Strikes Back) and there's too much high octane entertainment for it to ever be considered dull as a whole. But does the charge of action and effects over script and characters still stick, then? Well, yes, but this is George Lucas after all.....7.5/10"

175,tt0080684,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,10.0,"The original trilogy of Star Wars contain three films, all of which are sophisticated, imaginative and enormous fun. I feared it wouldn't be my thing, but it was exactly that. I loved the original trilogy for all those reasons. Empire Strikes Back maintains all the fun of its predecessor, while even darker and more mature. Visually it's a marvel to look at, with the stunning special effects and highly imaginative-looking sets. John Williams's score is just outstanding, epic and monumental in every way. The story is darker than that of New Hope and perhaps more sophisticated, and I loved the fact the filmmakers made the romance between Leia and Han more developed. The battle sequences are mesmerising, the beginning is bound to have you on the edge of your seat, but the battle between Luke and Darth Vader was simply out of this world. The script is still as affectionate as ever, the pace is fast and the acting is great. Mark Hamill is ever as likable as Luke, and Carrie Fisher still has her spunk and vivacity. Harrison Ford is noticeably more subdued, but he is still terrific, and Frank Oz is a perfect Yoda. Chewabacca is hilarious, and Darth Vader is a fantastic villain, especially when voiced so magnificently by James Earl Jones. All in all, a perfect successor to an already brilliant first film. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
176,tt0080684,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,9.0,"Though the intrepid three heroes of Star Wars destroyed the Death Star commanded by Darth Vader, the rebel army is still on the run. They've taken refuge in a frozen planet called Hoth much like George Washington and the Continental Army at Valley Forge. In the meantime the Empire still searches for the rebel army in The Empire Strikes Back.When the attack comes, it comes full force, the rebels flee as do Luke Skywalker and R2D2 in one ship and Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca and C3PO. Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker is given a mission in a dream by the late Alec Guinness, killed in the first Star Wars film to receive Jedi Knight Advanced Training from the legendary Yoda and he seeks him out. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher and company seek out Ford's old friend Lando Kalrissian to repair his ship after Ford plays a dangerous cat and mouse game with Darth Vader's battle cruiser.As Lando Kalrissian, Billy Dee Williams steps into the Star Wars pantheon of heroes and proves quite useful if not quite on the up and up. George Lucas continues his tradition of writing about futuristic Homeric like heroes in a galaxy far away. And as cinema, The Empire Strikes Back continues the quality of excellence that the original set. Looks like the Force is definitely with George Lucas."
177,tt0080684,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,,"The Empire Strikes Back (1980) **** (out of 4)The second film of the original trilogy has the Empire forcing their vengeance as Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) begins his Jedi training with Yoda while Hans Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca and the gang try to get to Darth Vadar.George Lucas directed the original STAR WARS in 1977, which was a tremendous hit with both fans and critics. He basically took a ""B"" movie idea, something you'd see at a Saturday matinée and made it into a high-quality picture. This sequel had Lucas turning the directing duties over to Irvin Kershner and the end result certainly raises it to an ""A"" movie and one that many fans believe is the greatest of the series. I'm not going to lie, I somewhat enjoy the original a tad bit more but that's not to say this is a bad movie. Far from that.What's rather amazing is the fact that the producers, director and screenwriters simply could have given us the same film again but instead they decided to make it much bigger, more darker and I'd argue they really wanted to blow the original out of the water. The film once again benefits from some terrific special effects, a rousing score from John Williams and there's no question that visually the film is a lot more impressive than the original.You've also got the cast back together with both Hamill and Fisher once again delivering the goods but also Billy Dee Williams and Alec Guinness in a bit part. Once again it's Harrison Ford who easily steals the film with his comic timing and just that hero persona that shines through. Plus, it's just magic seeing him and Chewbacca work together.THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is considered one of the greatest science fiction movies ever made and it's hard to argue with that."

Meanwhile, Luke goes to the Dagobah system and finds Jedi Master Yoda.There are superior popcorn movies in the Star Wars franchise although there is plenty of eye-popping action in this one. This is the best overall film in the series. The dialog is snappier. The combative romance between Leia and Han is the best. Everything looks great. It introduces Yoda and Lando. There are great legendary twists. It is a Star Wars movie for film fans. Even the Special Edition is the best of the original trio.

180,tt0080684,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,6.0,"""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" is the second film from the ""Star Wars"" franchise and the fifth in terms of chronology of the contents depicted in there. It was directed by Irvin Kershner over 35 years ago and had some success with the Academy Awards, even if not nearly as much as the first film. And I myself must say that I found it not better than the first (even if the IMDb rating says so), but also not much worse. Once again, it delivers especially on the visual side in terms of sets, cinematography and special effects while coming a bit short in terms of the story. The characters are all fairly memorable though, the humans and the others. There are many many characters that appeared in the first film already, for example Obi Wan Kenobi is even back for one scene, but there are also some interesting new additions, most of all the uber-famous Yoda. And Darth Vader is the main villain in here while being just one of several villains in the first film. A great light saber sequence is included here too.I said that I was not too overwhelmed by the story and that implies the plot as a whole, but also minor scenes and references. One example would be Calrissian's character obviously being totally scared of Vader for almost the entire film and then, completely out of nowhere, he suddenly has no fear anymore and joins the resistance fighters. Not very realistic character development. I also did not like the references in terms of mathematical probability early on. This makes it look really unrealistic that Skywalker survived or that Han Solo managed to control the spacecraft some time later.All in all, it was an okay watch at best and the film has several lengths, starts off nicely with the snow planet scenes, gets worse, but gains some momentum again towards the end. However, I believe that they could have done without roughly 20 minutes and kept this movie at 105 minutes instead of over two hours. You have to be very generous to appreciate this film as a whole as there were more than just a few weaknesses to it. Still, the good moments make somewhat up for it, even if the film never reached real greatness. Not once. Nonetheless, I will be generous and give it a cautious thumbs-up, especially for science fiction fans, which I am probably not really."
181,tt0080684,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,10.0,"The rebels' new base is hidden in the icy planet Hoth and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) commands a unit with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). During the investigation of a meteor crash, Luke is wounded and captured by a creature but succeeds to escape. While dying on the snow, he has a vision of Obi-Wan Kenobi telling him to go to the Dagobah system to be trained by the Jedi Master Yoda. Later he is saved by Han and they are rescued in the morning by the rebels. Meanwhile Darth Vader (David Prowse) sends probe droids through the galaxy to find the location of the base. The rebels are located and they need to leave the planet under the attack of the Imperial Fleet. However Luke heads to Dagobah to find Yoda while Leia, Han, Chewbacca and C-3PO travel to the planet Bespin to meet his friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) and repair the Millennium Falcon. However, they are betrayed by Lando and captured by Darth Vader. Meanwhile Luke has a premonition with his friends in danger and he decides to interrupt his training with Yoda to save them, despite the warning of Obi-Wan and Yoda. Will Luke be ready to face Darth Vader and save his friends? ""The Empire Strikes Back"", later retitled ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" is a fantastic sequel of Star Wars, with a great story. The plot has adventure, romance, comedy and betrayal and is engaging until the very end. The characters now are more experienced and bonded. The mannerisms of C-3PO recalls Dr. Smith, from ""Lost in Space"". This is the type of sequel that keeps the high quality of the original film. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""O Império Contra-Ataca"" (""The Empire Strikes Back"")"
182,tt0080684,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,,"The Rebellion has struck an important blow to the power of the Empire by destroying it's Death Star, however the power of the Dark Side of the Force remains strong and continues to hunt the rebellion. While the Rebellion base on Hoth is under treat, Luke has gone to a distant swamp planet to receive further Jedi training from Master Yoda. However the power of the dark side should not be underestimated and many dark truths are revealed as the threat of the Empire looms large.Following Star Wars was never going to be easy but this is actually better. Empire retains the same characters and the same sense of fun that the first had  the battle on Hoth is just one of THE moments of the series. However what gets added to that is a much darker strand. The Empire is not beaten by the destruction of one ship  it's power is barely dented in fact. This sees some startling revelations (I won't spoil it in case you've been living under a rock!) but also sees significant blows to the rebellion. In fact the ending of this film could not be more different from the end of Star Wars.Like the recent episode two this follows two strands  the more pedestrian scenes with Luke and Yoda and the more action based scenes with Han and company. The scenes with Yoda add depth to the film and hint at the truth. Meanwhile the other half is a lot more action orientated and has comedy and good new characters such as Bobba Fett. The two work well together and come together well for a great finale. The addition of a dark strand to the film makes it all the better as it can be enjoyed as a story and not just a fun sci-fi film with good effects.The characters are better here than the first. The strong characters from the first (Han, C3P0 et al) are all still good here. However we also get a much more interesting version of Luke as he continues his journey into becoming a full Jedi. Yoda is a good addition (despite sounding like Fozzie Bear!) and Darth Vader becomes a lot more than just a good villain  we learn his past, a revelation then, but a thing of common knowledge now.Overall this is as good as Star Wars at it's heart, but the darker nature of the film makes it much better. Where the first one was a victorious uprising this is, as the title suggests, the time in history where the Empire strikes back against the uprising. All the music, characters and things that make Star Wars Star Wars are here and it's simply one of the best of the series to date."
183,tt0080684,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,10.0,"The summary line is one of my favorite movie quotes of all time because it embodies a philosophy and a discipline. Whenever I hear someone say 'I'll try', I already know it's a cop out with no intention of getting involved with the task in question. Had George Lucas 'tried' to make the movie, it would never have gotten done. I guess that's why Yoda is my favorite Star Wars character. Yeah OK, he's a puppet, but the character of Yoda is like the Spock of the SW universe, a stabilizing force (Force?) who helps Luke remain grounded and in control of his emotions.I recall some disappointment the first time I saw this film during it's original theatrical release relative to the Han Solo cliffhanger, somehow I felt it took away from the structure I was looking for in the chapter following the original ""Star Wars"". Viewing it today I don't feel the same way. It dealt a momentary reprieve to the Han/Leia romance and allowed for analysis of the Darth/Luke relationship. Vader's attempt to shield his son from the Emperor by promising a turn to the Dark Side was ingeniously turned on it's head with Vader suggesting young Skywalker use his power to defeat the Emperor. The scene was cleverly done and Luke's response hinted at things to come in ""Return Of The Jedi"".My most recent viewing of this episode was only the third time since the original theatrical release, and I find that it hasn't lost any of it's impact, maintaining a vitality and excitement that time hasn't diminished. Watching the remastered DVD version, particularly with the sub titles, offers an entirely new perspective when you can pause and rewind to understand better what certain characters said. Perhaps that's why I found it a lot easier to keep track of the fine points of the story, place names like Hoth, Yavin and Bespin, and secondary characters like Governor Tarkin. All those subtle points add a more defined structure to the story, and helps one appreciate much more the intricacy of the universe created by George Lucas."
184,tt0080684,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,10.0,"I don't know whether or not ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was better than ""Star Wars"" or not, but it's pretty much equally good. Since everyone knows the plot, I figure that I'll just talk about a few aspects. It's weird to think that Yoda was only introduced here; he's been such a central character in the series that it's easy to forget that he didn't star in Episode 4! In some ways, watching ""TESB"", you get the feeling that the people behind the scenes realized how lucky the series was making them, and so they decided to go all out. And they do just that. They played it to good effect here (I personally thought that ""Return of the Jedi"" overdid it a little). But anyway, the Force is with this movie from start to finish!"
185,tt0080684,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,9.0,"Any comments here refer to the theatrical release, not the pile of rubbish known as the special edition. Rick McCollum should be tracked down and given a good kick in the pants.In your epic battles of good and evil, ""Empire Strikes Back"" pretty much takes the cake. We have everything here -- characters with depth, tragedy, romance, adventure... aliens that are believable. It has become cliché to compare ""Star Wars"" to ""Lord of the Rings"", and that's not entirely unfair... but, really, ""Star Wars"" is better and ""Empire Strikes Back"" is the best.As Dante Hicks says in ""Clerks"", this film is the best because it imitates life, ""a series of down endings"". Sometimes life is better than that, but it's often not. And whereas most movies want happiness, this one put Luke and Han in a bunch of bad situations with no hope of escaping unscathed. That's what makes this fantasy very much reality."
186,tt0080684,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,10.0,"One of the best film sequels ever made (along with The Godfather, Part II and Terminator 2), this is the second part to great original trilogy, and saga, from writer/creator George Lucas and director Irvin Kershner. ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away"" on the ice world of Hoth, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is investigating possible Empire activity, only to be attacked by a snow monster. He manages to escape with the help of the Force and his light sabre, but he is still stuck in the blizzard, and before going unconscious and being rescued by Han Solo (Harrison Ford), he sees a vision of Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi (Sir Alec Guinness) telling him to go to the Degobah system and find Jedi master Yoda. So after a quick battle between the Rebels and the Empire, Luke, with R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) heads to this planet, and eventually he finds Yoda (a Muppet style creature voiced and performed by Muppet member Frank Oz, aka Miss Piggy and Fozzie Bear), and they start training. Meanwhile, Han, Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) are in the Millennium Falcon, pursued by the Empire (because of a tracking device), and hide for a while in what they thought was the inside of a near meteor, but it was in fact the belly of a giant worm alien. When they do get out, they head for their destination to fix the ship, the planet Bespin, where they are greeted by Han's old shifty gambler friend (and original Millennium Falcon owner), Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). But what they didn't know is that Darth Vader (acted by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones) and the stormtroopers arrived before them, and they are the bait of Vader's trap to get Luke, who he has become obsessed with finding. As a prize for finding them, Han Solo is frozen in carbonate and (when confirmed he is alive) is give to bounty hunter Boba Fett (Jeremy Bulloch) to be delivered to crime lord Jabba the Hutt (who you saw in the first film). Eventually, Luke does land on the planet, and he and Darth have a long and exciting light sabre fight, while Leih's gang escape in the Millennium Falcon. The pinnacle twist and great quote of the film is, after cutting Luke's hand off, Darth Vader revealing the truth about his father's death, he says ""I am your father!"" After this he is eventually rescued, has his hand replaced, and Lando and Chewbacca fly away in the Millennium Falcon, a more more obvious 'to be continued' moment. Also starring Julian Glover as General Veers. It won the Oscar for Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Music for John Williams and a Special Achievement Award (for visual effects), it won the BAFTA for Best Original Film Music for John Williams, and it was nominated for Best Production Design/Art Direction and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score.

Outstanding!"
187,tt0080684,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,9.0,"Although called ""Episode V,"" this was second movie in the Star Wars 6-part installment and I've always thought one of the better entries in the series.If you watch the first Star Wars and then this one, you'll immediately see a vast improvement in the special-effects department. There is a much more polished look to this one, and improved sound In fact, the DVD transfer is outstanding considering the age of this film.While the first Star Wars was a bit subdued, this one picks up the action right from the start, although lulls are really appreciated because the first 40 minutes are pretty hectic. The most notable of those scenes are the gigantic robots which were awesome when this film first came out, and are still pretty good. The movie calms down after that opening land war but retains the viewer's interest with other things.The second half of the movie features two stories going on at once: the battle in space with most of the cast involved, and ""Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in a swampland involved in his training sessions with the Master Yoda.Some of the movie's dialog is still corny, especially between Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) with their love-hate relationship, but it's not overdone. What is overdone is constant bleating noises emanating from ""Chewbacca,"" the wookie. That sheep-in-heat noise can get annoying after awhile. The ""Rambo"" action continues as it did in the first film, with the villains firing everything at our heroes and never hitting them. Ludicrous, but part of the deal. Those things you just put up with as the film, overall, delivers another interesting adventure, far more than the first Star Wars and leading up to the next one, which was even better."
188,tt0080684,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,10.0,"Like most children who loved Star wars when it was first released I looked forward to the next big screen instalment of the saga. I was not disappointed. The action started almost immediately and keeps up throughout the film till the climactic light sabre battle. We are also introduced to the new interesting characters Yoda, Lando and the Emperor himself.As the film begins the rebels are on the run, hiding on the barren ice planet of Hoth and the empire is dispatching droids to search the galaxy for them. One lands not far from Luke and he sets off to investigate but before he can get far he is attacked by a yeti-like creature which drags him off to an ice cave. Luke manages to escape but it is too late for him to get back to the base and it looks like he might freeze to death. Luckily for him Han is out searching for him and eventually finds him just after he has a vision of his old friend Obi-Wan Kenobi who tells him to seek a Jedi master called Yoda on the planet Dagobah. Once back at the base the soon learn that the Empire has discovered where they are and start to evacuate. While this is occurring they must hold off an attack by imperial walkers which are attempting to destroy the shield protecting the base. Eventually the base falls but not before our heroes can escape.At this point the action splits, Luke and R2 fly to Dagobah and Han, Chewie, Princess Leah and C3PO flee in the Millennium Falcon. When Luke arrives on Dagobah he discovers the planet is one huge swamp into which his X-wing sinks. He and R2 soon find a strange creature who says that he can take them to Yoda, of course it turns out that he is Yoda, after some persuasion he begins to train Luke. Meanwhile back on the Falcon things aren't going according to plan; when ambushed by imperial star destroyers they discover that the hyper-drive isn't working so must hide in a dangerous asteroid field. Flying into cave on one of the larger asteroids the attacked by strange creatures that feed on the ships power cables, when they go outside to remove them they discover that the cave itself isn't what they thought it to be so must flee once more into the path of the imperial forces. Being a crafty pilot Han manages to escape from them but is pursued by the bounty hunter Boba Fett.Needing repairs they head to Cloud City in the nearby Bespin system. Here they are met by Han's old friend Lando Calrissian who offers to help them. Unfortunately for them Darth Vader got there sooner and made a deal with Lando. Meanwhile Luke has a vision that his friends are in danger and ends his training early to go and help, despite Yoda's warning that he is at risk from the dark side of the force and could make things worse. When he gets there he confronts Vader who tells him something that goes against everything he thought to be true... in the very unlikely event that you don't know already I'll avoid spoiling it.Like the original film this is full of excellent special effects but isn't swamped with excessive CGI like the more recent prequels. The acting and direction are both pretty good. Being the middle act of the original trilogy it is much darker in tone than the first film and the ending can hardly be called happy. I'd certainly recommend this film to anybody regardless of their age, it is one of the few sequels to improve on the first film of its series."
189,tt0080684,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,10.0,"In many ways ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" is the best and most outstanding of all the movies in the ""Star Wars"" franchise. There is just something epic and very impressive about the story and presentation of the movie.The entire battle of Hoth has left a very lasting impression on me and it captures the struggle of the Rebellion against the Empire very well, and it is filmed in such a manner that it feels like you are right there on the snow-clad battlefield yourself.It really is unnecessary to say how well the cast performed in the movie. But once again, all actors and actresses did prove how perfectly cast they were in this original trilogy.The storyline in ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" is very entertaining from start to end, and it has many different aspects and layers to it. And there really is something for everyone to be had in episode five of the ""Star Wars"" saga.Whether you are a fan of ""Star Wars"" or not then ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" is a movie that you just can't miss out on. And it is a movie that everyone is or should be familiar with."
190,tt0080684,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,10.0,"From it's opening scenes on the bleak ice-ball that is the planet Hoth, to its exciting finale on the cloud city of Bespin, The Empire Strikes back is a worthy sequel to the magnificent Star Wars. Taking over the directorial reins from George Lucas, Irvin Kershner steers the movie into darker territory to deliver a more mature movie than its predecessor.The Empire is still licking its wounds after the destruction of the Death Star, and evil Darth Vader is intent on finding the rebels responsible for destroying his new toy. Luke's aim, meanwhile, is to become a fully fledged Jedi knight, whilst Han sets himself a more difficult target: he plans on getting into Leia's knickers.With more incredible FX packed action scenes than you can shake a light-sabre at (highlights include the fantastic battle on Hoth, a chase scene through an asteroid field, and the Luke/Darth light-sabre duel), and THAT moment where we learn the truth about Luke's father, it's no surprise to find that this episode is often said to be the best of the series. Personally, A New Hope will always be my favourite (for sentimental reasons), but The Empire Strikes Back is a very close second."
191,tt0080684,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,6.0,"The first sequel to 1977's ""Star Wars"" was so hotly anticipated, it sparked the whole trend of film-goers sleeping outside movie theaters in droves, waiting anxiously for the eventual release. Once the picture premiered, it didn't seem to matter to the faithful that it was missing the frisky spirit of ""Star Wars"", as well as a solid finish. Mark Hamill returns as Luke Skywalker, being educated by mystical Yoda and facing off against Darth Vader, who reveals an unanticipated secret. Irvin Kershner's direction is thoughtful--he brings to the action sequences a deep undercurrent of purpose--but he's also mechanical, perhaps spending too much time with Luke (who, due to a car accident suffered in real-life by Hamill, has a perplexed, dour appearance). Harrison Ford provides lots of old-fashioned charm, the special effects and music are wonderful, but the cliffhanger finale wasn't really fair (at the time, it felt like a slap in the face). Producer/creator George Lucas re-released this to theaters in 1997 with three extra minutes and a lofty title change. **1/2 from ****"
192,tt0080684,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,,"My five children were all pre-teens when 'The Empire Strikes Back' came to the theater. While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, the 'Star Wars' trilogy filled our imaginations like no other movies before them. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.It is fruitless trying to argue 'which is best' in a trilogy, because the first one, in this case 'Star Wars', starts it all and has to be the 'father'. However, an argument can be made that 'The Empire Strikes Back' (now on DVD called Episode V) is overall a better-made movie which has more excitement, and grabs your imagination,than the other two original installments (now called parts IV and VI). The DVDs finally came out last month, and they are near perfect, as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high, and the picture is nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track. My wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi -- compliments of our local public library. It was an appropriate reminder how good these movies are, and still ahead of their time. Nothing else has been made to compare to them."
193,tt0080684,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,10.0,"This 2nd (or fifth) enstallment in the Star Wars series I believe is the best one yet (and ever). The special effects are as good if not better than the first film and the characters are much better than in the first. Though George Lucas didn't direct this enstallment, I think that's good because it gives the chance for Irvin Kershner a chance to see what he can put on the screen for us to watch. And it is actually quite good. With a terrific soundtrack by John Williams, the character Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz who is my favorite puppetter ever beside Jim Henson) and a startling revelation (this is the film where we find out Darth Vader's secret), this film is a dark, enchanting and great movie experience."
194,tt0080684,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,7.0,"Empire Strikes Back is widely called the best Star Wars film (to date) and it is clear to see why.It certainly contains lots of the iconic moments from the series and all the best lines. Hamill, Fisher and Ford all have eased into their lead roles and there is enough action for them all to be involved, even if after the first act they don't spend much time together.Whereas 'A New Hope' had a sluggish start this second film in the original trilogy opens with action and never really lets up after that. There are great fight scenes and technical effects that more than make up for the moments where it all gets a bit sci-fi jargon heavy.Is this the best Star Wars film, the one for future films to beat? Possibly."
195,tt0080684,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,,"The SonI am convinced that movies are about other movies more than life. The original ""Star Wars"" was a success in my opinion because it had three things:  a collection of images from other films, distinctly referencing them. Some were film- schoolish like the Kurosawa quotes. But most were like what Kurosawa himself referenced: already deeply embedded visual touchstones, not having lost their power in becoming clichés. These were collected in one large form, the Flash Gordan form let's call it, which all of us slightly knew. It could be recalled with enough familiarity to register but not enough to set expectations, so Lucas could fill the bucket with whatever he found and liked. a notion of a complete, understandable cosmology. Its the noir notion that laws of the universe exist and cannot be seen, and if they could they wouldn't be comprehensible. This notion is deep in film, so deep that when a movie comes along that posits a cosmology that is whole, and revealable, it shocks. What that movie did was give us enough of a glimpse into this to believe that we could understand the world, at least THIS world of the ""galaxy far away."" Remember when that original came out? The images were impressible, but what people talked about wasn't what they saw, but about how the world worked. It settled first in an ersatz religion among geeky kids and now has been swallowed by the ""simple"" US religions, and its presidential representative. the notion of a quest. Its an old form, but cast in the above noted situation, it takes new power. The traditional form, the Goethe-Lytton form was there to remind and reveal mysteries. Here it is clearer, to explain. There was a lowbrow professor at the time of a women's college that a TeeVee interviewer made popular. It was sort of a metaquest. This simple man said that we could actually understand the nature of trying to understand nature. It was a lucky break for Lucas, because it meshed with this shocking notion of a grand cosmology that we know our hero (check out the name: ""sky walker"") will grasp, master and show us.That was the first film. A huge success, just huge. It did change many things, but from my perspective the key thing was how it reset that great American invention of noir, as important as jazz, and liberty which form a sort of trilogy of contradictory, three-way tension.Okay. Now the second big Ted idea, the necessity for the equal size of steps in abstraction when you have two steps. It seems this is hardwired in the brain, a sort of human quantum mechanics. If you look back along the abstraction, say a cartoon in a cartoon, the distance between the two will be precisely the same as the surrounding cartoon.So, when they made the second Star Wars movie, they could reference the previous one in the way that it referenced its cinematic background. It had a writer in Kasden who knew how to do this. And it had a director in Lucas' film school teacher who did also. Neither had a huge hit other than this because it was such a cool setup, having such a thing to build on.You'll read lots about trying to humanize, and how faces were used. But all that is simply in the service of abstracting closer to us from the original, in equal portion. This is the son. Why did the franchise fail after this? Because there was no step left to abstract to and maintain the brand.(This comment is a replacement of one deleted for unknown reasons. This was requested by a reader.)Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
196,tt0080684,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,10.0,"Luke, Leia and Han are fighting with the rebels in the hope of defeating the Imperial forces. But Luke gets a calling to the planet Dagobah, where under the tutelage of Jedi Master, Yoda, he hopes to become a Jedi himself, but that also brings him closer to his, and Leia's, destiny.Lets tell it as it is, The Empire Strikes Back is a better film than Star Wars, not as impacting of course, but most definitely better. Technically, in story telling and in tone, it holds up well today and certainly warrants the amount of times it crops up in best sequels debates. That it's not actually a sequel is irrelevant, it is of course the filler in a wonderful sci-fi sandwich, because as second instalments go, Empire has few peers. With Empire Strikes Back we get all the whizz bang adventure strewn heart of Star Wars, but George Lucas (stepping aside for Irvin Kershner to direct) has also fleshed the story out with a serious dark tone that oddly becomes a bedfellow to the romantic fun on offer, where new and engaging characters (and creatures) add spice to this wonderful fantastical broth.Aided by the considerable writing talent of Leigh Brackett (The Long Goodbye, Rio Bravo, The Big Sleep), Lucas took the bold and ingenious step of giving the bad guys the upper hand, in fact it could be argued that he was taking a considerable risk with his ending. Forcing his viewers to wait for the final chapter (three years later), after tantalisingly setting us up with a corker of plot twist (one which is still to this day as potent as it was back on release), Lucas pulled perhaps one of the cheekiest carrot dangles in cinema history.Though more famed for its dark undertones, Empire is for sure still a very fun movie, C3PO goes into camp overdrive and Han Solo ups his quip quota by some margin. Then of course there is Yoda, in himself a comedic joy. The action sequences beg for repeat viewings, a battle on the ice laden planet Hoth is a marvel and the choreography for Skywalker's fight with Darth Vader is out of the top draw. But ultimately it's with the dark side that the picture excels. Complex and amazingly posing moral quandary's, The Empire Strikes Back is quite an experience, one that will forever hold up to repeat viewings for this particular viewer. 10/10"

The film gets off to a great start where the rebel forces on the Planet Hoth have to fight a battle against The Imperial Empire who are attacking the base using giant robotic camels . That alone makes it worth seeing and we get some smart liners between Han Solo and Princess lela and we get some smooth patter from Lando who gives a masterclass in how to impress a woman But ( There's always a conjunction ) most of the spectacle is confined to the first half of the film and after that the story concentrates on all the spiritual nonsense involving the force between Yoda and Luke Skywalker . Some people may be surprised that Mark Hamill's career as a movie star didn't take off but one wonders why he was cast in the franchise in the first place since he makes a rather wet unlikely hero rather than the youthful everyman the role is written as . Watching Hamill try and carry his scenes shows how unimpressive he is and how good the rest of the cast are in comparison THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is a good Summer blockbuster but the brutal truth is that it's no more than that . It was made in an era before CGI dominated spectacular FX driven films at the turn of the century and that alone makes it worth seeing even if the most impressive scenes happen in the first half .

199,tt0080684,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,10.0,"Story author and executive producer George Lucas truly managed to outdo himself when it came to making a sequel to his landmark 1977 ""Star Wars"" film. It combines an appreciably high level of character development with some genuinely exciting and riveting scenes, and introduced the well loved character of diminutive Jedi master Yoda into the formula. Villainous Darth Vader is brought to the forefront rather than being a lackey to somebody else. The relationship between cocky spaceship pilot Han Solo and serious minded rebel leader Princess Leia evolves to where romance can finally take place. And Luke Skywalker becomes more than just the naive and idealistic farm boy, letting his emotions get the better of him.With the directing chores being handed over to Irvin Kershner (""A Fine Madness"", ""Up the Sandbox"", ""Eyes of Laura Mars""), ""The Empire Strikes Back"" marks a maturation in terms of story quality, as well as a willingness to go to some dark places. After all, as it begins, it sees its hero in serious jeopardy. It's never treated as a given that Good will prevail. The screenplay is credited to Leigh Brackett (""The Big Sleep"", ""Rio Bravo"", ""El Dorado"") and Lawrence Kasdan (""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""Body Heat"", ""The Big Chill""), and stars Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher make the most of the material. The endearing Yoda is one of those examples of a puppet who truly does become a character rather than just a gimmick. The film is a little short on cool aliens, but it does feature a Yeti-like monster called a Wampa, and an enormous slug used in a funny ""worm in the apple"" sort of gag. The spectacle is fantastic, but it never overwhelms the story. The early battle scene on the ice fields of the planet Hoth is incredibly well executed, and the final lightsaber duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader (who of course has a revelation in store for the youngster) offers one thrill after another.The special effects are as impressive as ever, and it would be difficult to hear that memorable John Williams score and not get into the spirit of the thing. You truly care about the characters and want to see what will happen with them. And it delivers an ending that perfectly captures a sense of uncertainty and a degree of despair, setting up the problems to be solved in the next film.This is definitely a milestone blockbuster that holds up well 33 years later.10 out of 10."
200,tt0086190,Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,9.0,"So what made this movie a step down than its two predecessors? Well, forgive me for nit picking, but I didn't think the humour is as strong as it was in New Hope and Empire Strikes Back. Plus, while it was evident, the romantic elements weren't as developed either. However, putting these flaws aside, it is still enormously entertaining, thanks to the elaborate set pieces and the well choreographed battles(the final battle especially was a knockout). And I will say that it is a vast improvement over the prequels. The plot is still fast paced and sophisticated, and the screenplay while not as fun still is as imaginative as ever.I have heard many complaints about the Ewoks. I think it depends on your perspective whether you like them or not; maybe a delight to younger audiences, maybe too sickly cute to an adult. Being a 17 year old female, I thought they were very cute. The acting is still very impressive, with Mark Hamill spontaneously likable in the lead. Frank Oz is a perfect Yoda and his death scene is heart rending, and Ian McDairmund also steals his scenes as the Emperor. Harrison Ford, in an inspired bit of casting is great again as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher is still vivacious and Alec Guiness the great actor that he was is brilliant as Obi Wan. But my favourite is James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader, his majestic booming voice is very ideal for a dark menacing villain. And I must mention John Williams's music, brilliant and innovative, unquestionably one of the best film scores of all time. All in all, while my least favourite of the original trilogy, Return of the Jedi makes for essential viewing. 9/10 Bethany Cox."
201,tt0086190,Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,9.0,"About the only criticism I can make of Return Of The Jedi is that the film could easily have been two films. The story of Han Solo's rescue from Jabba The Hut and then the final confrontation with the Empire should have been two films. That would have been double the pleasure for fans of the series. As it stands now the folks there in that galaxy far away are in a happy ever after ending of their saga.The same old familiar faces from Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back are with us again. Harrison Ford was betrayed by Billy Dee Williams to the Empire who turned him over to Jabba, but the others affect an escape helped by the selfsame Billy Dee who did not like being reduced to a hireling in what was his former planet.Mark Hamill as the budding Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker learns the true nature of his existence and of the temptation to go over to the dark side of the Force. The path of light might be rougher, but it does not carry the same burdens. Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia finally chooses between Hamill and Harrison, although the script kind of makes the choice for her.George Lucas when he made additional films opted for the prequel showing how the situation came to be in the galaxy far away. He could still do a sequel, but unless he does this is it for the beloved characters of Star Wars.Return Of The Jedi got several Oscar nominations in technical categories all richly deserved. Something tells me we haven't seen the last of these people and the other creatures of their galaxy."

After a massive fight the attention turns to Darth Vadar who Luke hopes to bring back from the dark side.RETURN OF THE JEDI is the weakest of the original three films but don't for a second think that it's a bad movie. In fact, it's another very good entry in the series and for the most part it's a nice way to end the original trilogy. This film, once again, tries to be even bigger than the previous one, which it is in many ways but at the same time there's no denying that you start to feel the 134 minute running time.Still, there are so many great moments here that you can't help but get caught up in everything going on. You've got Hamill, Fisher, Billy Dee Williams and Ford all in top-gear and they obviously deliver strong performances. Chewbacca is back and naturally steals every scene that he's in. The action scenes are some of the best of the series with the stuff in outer space looking 100% authentic but we also get some fun stuff on land including the aircraft race through the forest.Yoda, R2-D2 and C-3PO are all return but we're also introduced to the Ewoks. It seems fans are split on how ""good"" they are. I'm sure kids loved seeing these little creatures and while I won't deny they're cute, at the same time I'm not sure how much they add. With that said, RETURN OF THE JEDI falls just short of the previous two films but it's a nice way to close out the trilogy."

We were stuck in the front row. I've seen it many times since. The Jabba the Hutt section is terrific. Slave Leia taking control of the deck gun is amazing. Almost everything is perfect. The speeder bike sequences are terrific action and the space battle is great. The allure of the dark side is powerfully shown. The only drawback are the Ewoks. They simply look too much like teddy bears and speaks to Lucas' need to play to the kids. Some at-st destruction seems too unlikely. It's like a kid imagining fun silly ways to destroy his toy at-st. Those are minor problems. As for the Special Edition changes, most are fine and unnecessary. There is one glaring, horrifying change. The song and dance at Jabba the Hutt's palace is undeniably bad.

It was made 6 years after the original and was the first that did not win any Oscars, but still scored 4 nominations. Fans of the possibly biggest franchise in film history often consider this one the weakest from the 3 early films, but I cannot agree with this sentiment. It may even be my favorite from the trio. They included many interesting new characters, elaborated nicely on the old ones and there is one of the most famous villains in film history in here. The locations are fairly great to watch as well.The film is pretty long, runs for roughly 135 minutes, but there was rarely a moment when I felt it dragged and to me it also seemed as if most of the actors have stepped up their games by 1983. George Lucas only appears as writer in here and the director is Richard Marquand, probably not a name known to too many outside the Star Wars universe. Unlucky for him, he also died way too early. But I think he did a fairly memorable job here. What I liked the most about his film here are probably all the colorful, memorable characters, especially the cute furry ones.But the film also delivers on the dramatic side, especially in terms of Yoda and in terms of tragedy involving core characters. And for the great sci-fi lovers, there are also many great locations in space and spectacular special effects sequences. I am not one of the latter, which is also why I only give the film a ***/*****, but this should not keep you from watching this one here, especially if you are bigger on the genre than I am.

""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"" is the last episode of the fantastic saga. In 1983, this film was a sensation and now, in 2015, it has not lost the impact. On the contrary, now watching the episodes in sequence the viewer can see that George Lucas had the whole story in details in his mind. And now let's see the next episode. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""O Retorno de Jedi"" (""The Return of the Jedi"")"
207,tt0086190,Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,,"Han Solo has been captured by Jabba the Hutt, but C3P0 and R2D2 come to rescue him with some other help too. Once free from Jabba, Han joins with the Rebels to prepare to launch an attack on an all new Death Star being produced. Luke goes for further Jedi training with Yoda but is later captured by Vader himself. Battles rage in space but also on the moon of Endor as the Rebels try to prevent the Empire taking over the Galaxy.This should have been the best of the series  the Jedi striking back after getting a kicking in part 5. Indeed the battles and plotting suggests that it could have been. Certainly the final confrontation between Luke and Vader could have been even better than the end of part 5, however it just doesn't feel as good as it could have been.The focus is very much on Luke and how he has changed since his discovery of this father. Now he is dressed all in black and seems more ruthless than before. This is explored reasonably well but it isn't as dark as it should have been  I never really believed that Luke could go to the Dark Side. The rest of the story is spoilt by one thing  Muppets. This was supposed to be the big climax of the `three' films, we get that but we also have lots of puppets. The Ewoks are OK as characters but the whole film has far too many puppets in it to be good. Coming off the back of a much darker empire, Jedi is like walking out of a dark place into the light  it's just too bright and cheerful. It should have had layers.Hamill is good as Luke but I wanted more depth  that said was good here but not as good as in Empire. If you watch his three films together then you see him change which makes you appreciate him more. Ford has little to do  it's like we've seen his space cowboy act before. Fisher is the same but has more to do. Ian McDiarmid is good  but again I appreciate his character even more now that I've seen parts one and two. Yoda is cool but after Empire his screen time seems cut down (mind you part 2 made up for that). Darth Vader is interesting  it's a bit sad but how many other characters have been played by three people (at the same time  not at different ages). Vader's body is Prowse, his voice is Jones and his face is Shaw.Overall this is good  simply because it's a Star Wars movie and has plenty of action and thrills. The muppets and brighter mood stop it being as good as the two before but at least now the Phantom Menace has shown us what a bad Star Wars film is like, now we know that Jedi isn't the weak link in the series."
208,tt0086190,Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,9.0,"I recall the controversy some time prior to the original theatrical release regarding the title. ""Revenge of the Jedi"" was scrapped because it was deemed too harsh for mainstream movie audiences and didn't fit in with the noble character of the Jedi Knights. I couldn't quite understand that argument considering all the country had gone through after Watergate and Vietnam, and since movies and other forms of entertainment were getting more and more outrageous. Still, ""Return Of The Jedi"" works pretty well to convey the essence of the story, as Luke Skywalker stays true to his promise to avoid falling to the peril of the Dark Side of the Force.As I watched the film today, I wondered about the chronology and aging of the principal characters against the progress of the story, so I managed to dig up a Star Wars time line as published in one of the Dark Horse Comics from 2000. Even though ""The Empire Strikes Back"" occurs three years following ""A New Hope"", 'Return' occurs only one year later. It appeared that Mark Hamill aged considerably more than his co-stars in the intervening years between the first and third movie, a period of six years. Maybe it's just me, but since it was noticeable, I thought I'd mention it.Though I found 'Return' as compelling and entertaining as the rest of the series, a couple of things did bother me back in the day, and those thoughts still linger. After the destruction of the original Death Star in the first film, I thought it was a little lazy to return to the same concept with an attack strategy that was fairly similar the first time around. The Ewok population on Endor may have distracted from that scenario, but the resolution was basically the same.The other thing, given the huge popularity he achieved after brief appearances in the films, it was somewhat disappointing to see how easily Boba Fett was taken out during the battle at the Sarlacc Pit, given his vaunted reputation as a fearsome galaxy bounty hunter. With the back story created for Boba Fett in ""Attack Of The Clones"", I wonder if Lucas would have offed him so unceremoniously if Episodes IV, V, and VI were made chronologically following I, II, and III. Something to think about, considering how much more was written about Boba Fett in comics and books after his death in 'Return'.Say, did anyone else notice that Lucas cleverly reversed the ""I love you""/""I know"" responses between Han and Leia as he prepares to join the battle on Endor? I only managed to catch that because I watched the films back to back over a couple of days. Not that I'm a huge Star Wars fan, but that's something that stood out.With the original trilogy completed in 1983, it would be a long wait until ""The Phantom Menace"" appeared to begin the story of Anakin Skywalker some sixteen years later. Yet it only seems like yesterday that all the episodes burst on the scene to create the greatest sci-fi adventure ever. The Force will be around for generations to come to thrill and entertain as they did from the very start."

Granted, it's good that they wanted to show how everything would turn out, but it almost seemed more like a video game. The Ewoks were funny, but not much else. And why did they dress Carrie Fisher like they did early in the movie? Oh well. Life goes on. Now that we've had episodes 1-3, we see where this all originated. Or to put it in Yoda talk: where this all originated we seen have. Worth seeing, but don't interpret it as a masterpiece."

He hands himself in to the Empire, and soon enough, Vader takes him to the psychopathic Emperor (Ian McDiarmid). As the battle between the Rebels and Empire goes on outside, and the Emperor convinces him of his friends being in danger, Luke eventually catches his light sabre to have a fight with Darth Vader, and release the Dark Side that the Emperor wants to see. Eventually, Han, Leia and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) knock out the satellite power, and Lando in the Millennium Falcon head for the centre of the Death Star. Luke ends the fight after cutting his father's hand off, and refuses to join the Dark Side, to which the Emperor starts electrocuting him with his Syth power. Darth Vader has a sudden change of heart though when he grabs the still electrocuting Emperor and tosses him off the edge. In his dying moments, he asks Luke to take his mask off so he can see him with his own eyes, and you see why he wheres the mask, and then he dies. Lando meanwhile reach the centre, blow it up, Luke gets away just in time, and the Death Star explodes. The ending has Darth Vader, or Anakin Skywalker rather, cremated, and everyone having fun at the concluding party, where Luke sees all three people that have helped him, the ghosts of Ben, Yoda, and of course, his father. Also starring Sebastian Shaw as Anakin Skywalker. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Music for John Williams, Best Sound and a Special Achievement Award (for visual effects), and it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Make Up Artist, Best Production Design/Art Direction and Best Sound. Star Wars was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and the film was number 87 on The Ultimate Film. Very good!"
211,tt0086190,Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,9.0,"Up until the sixth and last episode of the Star Wars saga, which finally ended in 2005, I had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film of the long-running series. The varied action scenes and really different characters (Jabba The Hut, furry woodland creatures, etc.) made this a particularly appealing movie.None of the action ever focused too long in one spot, either. The last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laser-duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader.Another nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of in-fighting between two of the stars. Gone was the incessant bickering between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Finally, everyone was on the same page! It was nice to see.In the end, this was simply a wonderful adventure tale, more than anything else."
212,tt0086190,Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,8.0,"While this is probably the weakest of the original trilogy it is still an enjoyable film with all the thrills we'd come to expect in the series and it provides a good conclusion to the saga.When the film start we learn that the Empire is building a new Death Star and Darth Vader has been sent to oversee its construction. Meanwhile on Tatooine Luke and the gang are attempting to rescue Han, who is still frozen in Carbonite, from Jabba the Hutt. Things don't appear to be going according to plan as most of them get captured and Jabba plans to execute most them by throwing them in to a pit inhabited by a strange beast. Leah however was put in a very skimpy costume and chained to Jabba which might be a fate worse than death. Not too surprisingly our heroes escape and head back to the rebel fleet.On the way Luke pays a visit to a very old friend on Dagobah to finish his training but he is told that he has finished but to become a Jedi he must face Darth Vader once more. He gets back to the fleet as they are planning their attack on the new Death Star. Before the main assault can take place they must disable the shield generator on the planet below, a mission will me lead by our heroes.On the planet they meet a strange race of creatures known as Ewoks who after a little misunderstanding is sorted out trust the group and help them confront the Imperial forces. Luke however realises that Vader is there and knows his presence is endangering the mission so he surrenders and is taken to Vader who flies with him to the Death Star where he meets the emperor and has his final battle against Darth Vader whilst the rebel fleet is attacking.As with all the original Star Wars films the isn't the cluttered CGI of the new films however some of the once great effects took dated as the blue screen scenes are fairly obvious, they are still exciting though, especially the chase though the forest on ""speeder-bikes"". The acting was good and it was nice to see Sir Alec Guinness return is a cameo as the spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi. The Ewoks do look like overgrown teddy bears but I'm sure they will appeal to the younger viewer.This review was based on an older video release so doesn't include the various updates George added later."
213,tt0086190,Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,9.0,"I love the entire original ""Star Wars"" trilogy and I grew up watching them. And as a child I did like the ewoks a lot. But now having grown up I find it way too much that the military-trained forces of the Galactic Empire were bested by the primitive ewoks.The whole segment with Tattooine and the events with and around Jabba the Hutt were great. Although I always found Boba Fett's fate to be very anti-climatic.Story-wise then ""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"" is good fun and wholesome entertaining. The love romance between Han Solo and Leia Organa comes to a good conclusion, and Luke Skywalker's journey to become a jedi knight also holds some good events and surprises.The cast in ""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"" did great jobs, as they had been doing since episode IV.""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"" has lots of great creature designs, vehicles, spaceships, characters and atmosphere. All in the spirit of the ""Star Wars"" universe.I am rating ""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"" nine out of ten stars, since the ewoks (despite their cuddly cuteness) does bring something silly and childish to the movie. And the movie had fared better without the teddybears."
214,tt0086190,Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,9.0,"Return of the Jedi is often regarded by fans as the weakest of the original Star Wars trilogy, and whilst this is probably true, this in no way means that it is a bad film; on the contrary, with this episode, director Richard Marquand delivers a hugely enjoyable family movie that is packed with thrills and incredible special effects sequences from start to finish. It's just not quite as brilliant as its predecessors.Han Solo, trapped in carbonite, has been delivered to the palace of Jabba the Hutt (by bounty hunter Boba Fett), where he is displayed as a trophy by the huge slug-like space criminal. However, Han's rebel pals successfully carry out a daring rescue mission and, with the gang reunited, an attack is launched on the Empire's new improved Death Star, which is nearing completion.Luke's somewhat strained relationship with his old man is explored further, and it is also revealed that another member of the Skywalker family exists (providing the bad guys with an additional potential convert to the dark side of The Force).Return of the Jedi may not be perfectthe overly-cutesy Ewoks who aid the rebels are hated by many viewers, whilst the final attack scene is really nothing more than a rehash of Episode IV's assault on the original Death Starbut it is still a damn sight better than the abominations that are the Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. The visual effects are superbly executed, the action sequences genuinely exciting (in particular, the speeder bike chase gets the old neck hairs standing on end) and the whole movie looks great. If you can overlook the occasional silly 'comedy' moment and the odd lapse of logic (how did those Ewoks get those elaborate traps set up so quickly?), you'll have a blast!Just make sure not to watch the 1997 Special Edition, which saw Lucas add several nasty GGI 'improvements', including a terrible new musical number set in Jabba's palace, a poorly realised Sarlacc monster, some naff celebration scenes, and the iffy inclusion of Hayden Christensen as Anakin's 'ghost'."
215,tt0086190,Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,,"My five children were growing up but all still at home when 'Return of the Jedi' came to the theater. While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, the 'Star Wars' trilogy filled our imaginations like no other movies before them. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.After the fantastic 'Star Wars' and 'Empire Strikes Back' (now called parts IV and V on DVD), the last episode 'Return of the Jedi' was bound to be somewhat of a let down, but not much of one. It was made to achieve resolution. Of the rebels' battle with the evil Empire. The relationship between Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, and the Princess, and her relationship with Han Solo. We witness Luke's Jedi training at the hands of Yoda, as Luke becomes the Last Samurai, I mean Jedi. The DVDs finally came out last month, and they are near perfect, as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high, and the picture is nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track. My wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi (now on DVD called parts IV, V, and VI) -- compliments of our local public library. It was an appropriate reminder how good these movies are, and still ahead of their time. Nothing else has been made to compare to them."
216,tt0086190,Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,8.0,"Return of the Jedi is the last of the series (episode 6) and it may not be the best of the series, but like the other films, it still is all in good fun (and the Flash Gordon matinae serials). The story brings Luke Skywalker to confront his father for the second time with Emperor Palpatine helping along. Also, a group of freedom fighters (led by Han Solo), try to shut down a power base on the moon Endor that is controling the second Death Star. By the way, don't forget the first half hour of the movie which shows the gang freeing Han from Jabba the Hutt. This story is just the beginning of a fun, entertaining and important film that goes just right with the other six (or three) sagas."
217,tt0086190,Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,5.0,Until 'The Force Awakens' this was the last episode of the Star Wars saga and sees young Luke Skywalker face the evil Darth Vader for the final time.Although it's not as loved as the previous two films that make up the original trilogy there is still a lot of good things to say about this film. Apart from giving us the final showdown that we've been waiting for we are also treated to several other big chases and action sequences.Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher continue to impress and Mark Hamill does a good job of playing Luke's journey from young farm boy to Jedi knight convincingly.The only thing that slightly lets the film down is the Ewok subplot that continues to divide opinion to this day.Overall a nice end to the original trilogy.
218,tt0086190,Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,8.0,"Following on from the freshness of Star Wars (1977) and the all round greatness of craft and story telling that was The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Return of the Jedi was always going to struggle in comparison. That's not to say there are not fans who prefer it of the original trilogy, because there are many, and like minded fans of George Lucas' space saga shouldn't have a problem with that.However, it is the weakest of the three. The characters we have come to love, and to be a part of their universe, are performed with gusto - but they are mostly thinly written, reduced to playing second fiddle to special effects, while the dark heart has been replaced with - well - smokey hokey (furry teddy bears with sticks and stones, I ask you). Then there's the lack of sexual tension so evident in the previous two films. Oh we love Han and Leia because that's love! But one can't help missing the sparks that was once between them - and Luke of course, hmm...Yet for all that, of the irks and complaints, Return of the Jedi is still a thrilling film, the budget up on the screen to entertain the children and the adults with the child within. Characters and creatures wander into this wonderful world for super impact. The Emperor, Jabba the scene stealer, Rancor and Sarlaac, while the speeder bike chase, further lightsaber shenanigans and the space battle ensure the action is never far away - even if one can be a little underwhelmed by the big finale not being all it can be.Ultimately it was not without faults, but still it was one hell of a conclusion to a genre defining (then) trilogy. 8/10"
219,tt0086190,Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,8.0,"Amazing to think that this was once considered the weak link of the original ST trilogy . Time has told us that THE PHANTOM MENACE and its two follow ups shows us that that there's a sucker born every minute who will watch any old rubbish if it ties in with STAR WARS . While watching RETURN OF THE JEDI I was struck as to how impressive it was in its own right never mind compared to the prequels spewed up by Lucas but also how superior it was to James Cameron's AVATAR a film that owes a lot to this one Story wise JEDI is no great shakes , being just a retread of the most part of the first film where The Imperial Empire are building a Death Star and the Rebel Alliance trying to stop them . Where the film does succeed is a sense of humour when the first half concentrates on the droids R2D2 and the camp and cowardly C3PO as they find themselves at the mercy of Jabba . Some fans of the series might complain that this loses some of the darkness that EMPIRE contained but as someone who isn't this was welcomed by me since it makes the film more watchable as a neutral audience member The story then jumps to the forest world of Endor which is populated by Ewoks . Lucas is on record as saying a technologically advanced power being beaten by a backward guerrilla force was inspired by Vietnam and you can see the parallels to an extent and while you won't be reminded of APOCALYPSE NOW you are aware that that Cameron had the same idea with AVATAR but at least the scenes on Endor don't suffer from the ponderous effects laden self importance we got with CameronRETURN OF THE JEDI ends the trilogy that became part of a great number of peoples childhoods . I was never taken too much by the STAR WARS films though I was impressed by the costume design and I can see why so many people fell in love with the original movies . They are entertaining where the story telling and special effects compliment one another rather than the story being written around the effects and set pieces as happens in so many films in the 21st Century so even for nostalgic reasons I can understand he affection the films are held in . Just a pity Lucas had to go and ruin things by later making a trilogy of product placement"

221,tt0086190,Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,8.0,"George Lucas and company bring closure to the lives of the original beloved characters in this admittedly long and episodic but compelling 6th chapter. It's an emotional journey, to be sure, more emotional than the first two films, but it offers enough excitement and humour to make it great diversionary entertainment. The actors settle into their old roles comfortably and are very well supported by a rich variety of human and alien characters. With the directing reins now turned over to Richard Marquand (hired for this gig based on his direction of the thriller ""Eye of the Needle""), the story is broken into a few major set pieces.Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Lando Calrissian and others reunite to rescue their good friend Han Solo from the decadent palace of loathsome alien slug Jabba the Hutt, the powerful crime kingpin for whom Han had once smuggled goods. The action moves to Dagobah, where Luke confronts Yoda over the matter of his parentage, and on to the woodsy moon of Endor where the Rebels are plotting to destroy the shield that the Empire is using to protect its latest Death Star battle station. And Luke finally has the confrontation with his father Darth Vader and the deadly, seductive Emperor (a deliciously evil Ian McDiarmid) that Ben and Yoda had insisted would be inevitable.While lacking the innovative nature of the first film, and dark, more mature quality of the second, this entry does bring a satisfying conclusion to the saga, in the spirit of those old adventure serials of decades past. John Williams' music is as rousing as it's ever been, and the filmmakers once again plunge us into an assortment of different environments (desert, swamp, forest, etc.) The chase and battle sequences are truly breathtaking and impressive. The early scenes in Jabbas' palace allow the creature and makeup departments to come up with moments that can rival the memorable cantina segment from ""Star Wars"". That brings this review to the matter of the Ewoks, those fuzzy teddy bears whom a fair amount of the audience profess to hate. All this viewer can say is that he's never had a problem with them.Particularly enjoyable is the resolution to Luke's relationship with Vader, as the black clad villain rediscovers his humanity when forced to make a choice. Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't bring up certain scenes with Leia, which have intrigued scores of boys and men over the years.""Return of the Jedi"" may not be as good as its predecessors overall, but it's still quite a bit of fun.Eight out of 10."
222,tt0086190,Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,8.0,"Considered the Weakest of the Original Trilogy by most, ""Jedi"" Certainly Suffers from Tonal Shifts and Inconsistent Vibes.The First Act is Full of Horrific and Repulsive Imagery. From the Droid Torture Chamber to Jabba the Hutt's ""Party Palace"" to the ""Rancor"", the Movie Starts almost like a Horror Film.The Middle with the Ewoks is Cringe Worthy Cuteness and of course the ""Ending"" with Father and Son is Extremely Melodramatic. The Emperor's attempted Killing of Luke and His Taunting to Embrace the Dark Side is Excruciatingly Drawn Out.The Fluctuating Feelings and Changing Tapestry throughout the Movie render a somewhat Clunky Tonality to the Overall Effort.There are still Plenty of Things to Admire in the Production. The Space Battle Sequences and other SFX Heavy Scenes, like the Speeder Bikes can Impress even Today.The Film can also be Burdened with the Enormous Popularity and Excellence of ""Empire"" and the Groundbreaking Awe of the First Film. These are only a Few of the Reasons that ""Jedi"" doesn't quite measure up to the Previous Pictures.The Movie did make more Money, because of the Growing Fan Base, and the Anticipatory Aspect of the Intervening Three Year Wait. While not a Perfect Finale to the Trilogy it is still a Fine Effort and can Entertain Cultists and Newbies with its Rich Legacy and Retro Appeal."
223,tt0086190,Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,8.0,"Just as in the other films, the sound and special effects, as well as the costumes and makeup and John Williams' music were all fantastic.Mark Hamill gave an excellent performance along with Carrie Fisher and Billy Dee Williams under the direction of Richard Marquand, the writer of Nowhere to Run and The Eye of the Needle, who died a few years after this film.This was a great film for the whole family and one that shows evil empires, Dark Lords, and those that subvert democracy will eventually fail. Well, one certainly hopes so.A real thrill!"
224,tt0086190,Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,10.0,"Men in Black don't have anything on the man in black... Luke Skywalker.Why this movie doesn't have a higher rating, I don't know. Maybe it's because of the ewoks (that's why my mother doesn't like it as much). I say: those ewoks had very little to do with the creative genius of this movie.It was a masterpiece. It all came together perfectly and seamlessly. It even started off terrificly with Luke Skywalker showing off his full fledged Jedi skills. There is action, humor, action, honor, and more action... and the special effects... whew, light years ahead of its time. We were treated with two epic battles: the inter-galactic battle between the federation and the rebel forces, and the smaller but equally important battle between Luke and the Emperor, Luke and his father, and Luke and the Dark Side. Luke was in a perilous struggle internally with his feelings. You could see as he was slowly being poisoned with anger, concern, and perhaps a bit of fear. The Emperor had a very grand plan in mind for Luke and the rebel forces. That plan was all coming to fruition except for the will power and intelligence of Luke and Han Solo. As a child ""Return of the Jedi"" was my absolute favorite bar none. Well, Since childhood ""The Empire Strikes Back"" has toppled it. I'm a little older now and being more knowledgeable, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a bit more intellectually appealing. Even still, ""Return of the Jedi"" ranks extremely high with me and always will."
